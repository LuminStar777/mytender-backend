These workshops will establish a one team culture and shared vision, covering a range of key topics, including IT Integration, KPI requirements, process mapping, supply chain management, social value commitments, people, recruitment, objectives and health & safety.  We will meet with our clients and stakeholders weekly to cover all aspects of the mobilisation process, to ensure that we are prepared and ready for the start of the contract.  On many of our contracts, we have engaged with resident/leaseholder groups and invite them to mobilisation workshops to input into shaping our service delivery.  To encourage resident involvement and participation, a Go Live welcome event is held.  By fully understanding what stakeholder requirements are, we can deliver a service that suits their needs. We also engage with local communities during mobilisation to promote the contract to introduce ourselves.  How we would guarantee effective ongoing performance monitoring and feedback mechanisms to manage underperformance  Our Operations Manager will be responsible for establishing the report requirements, to reflect the framework requirements and each Member’s specific contractual KPIs, performance and satisfaction management and quality assurance.  The contract specifications and expectations, together with key performance indicators, will form part of our mobilisation workshops in order to understand the targets and standards required.  The Contracts Manager will have overall responsibilities to ensure contract requirements are being maintained, this includes performance monitoring and reporting against service delivery KPIs.  Weekly contract meetings will be held to review performance.  They will reinforce performance objectives to our workforce and ensure they are aware of expectations.  Quality standards and procedures are communicated to operatives and subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.  Our inspection processes consider both the physical quality work, together with resident feedback; by reviewing this data, together with other indicators, we are able to quickly focus on and respond to underperformance – thereby improving quality satisfaction with our services.  Quality feedback will be collected from our works management system and formed into statistical data using our reports functionality and reports are presented at monthly review meetings with corrective action plans agreed for implementation and review. Internal audits will be scheduled throughout the year to assess the effectiveness of our internal systems and void processes.  What measures you will implement to respond to underperformance  Monthly performance monitoring and regular management reviews are carried out to evaluate performance against contract objectives. Performance will be reported monthly to PfH partners and shared with stakeholders. Underperformance rectification will be overseen by the Contracts Manager, with a timescale agreed with the client for this to be achieved.  The outcome will be shared at contract meetings.  Through continuous improvement meetings, we can share our analysis and work together to agree solutions and performance targets.  We also review and reward positive performance, sharing results with our contract colleagues.

We will meet with our clients and stakeholders weekly to cover all aspects of the mobilisation process, to ensure that we are prepared and ready for the start of the contract.  On many of our contracts, we have engaged with resident/leaseholder groups and invite them to mobilisation workshops to input into shaping our service delivery.  To encourage resident involvement and participation, a Go Live welcome event is held.  By fully understanding what stakeholder requirements are, we can deliver a service that suits their needs. We also engage with local communities during mobilisation to promote the contract to introduce ourselves.  How we would guarantee effective ongoing performance monitoring and feedback mechanisms to manage underperformance  Our Operations Manager will be responsible for establishing the report requirements, to reflect the framework requirements and each Member’s specific contractual KPIs, performance and satisfaction management and quality assurance.  The contract specifications and expectations, together with key performance indicators, will form part of our mobilisation workshops in order to understand the targets and standards required.  The Contracts Manager will have overall responsibilities to ensure contract requirements are being maintained, this includes performance monitoring and reporting against service delivery KPIs.  Weekly contract meetings will be held to review performance.  They will reinforce performance objectives to our workforce and ensure they are aware of expectations.  Quality standards and procedures are communicated to operatives and subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.  Our inspection processes consider both the physical quality work, together with resident feedback; by reviewing this data, together with other indicators, we are able to quickly focus on and respond to underperformance – thereby improving quality satisfaction with our services.  Quality feedback will be collected from our works management system and formed into statistical data using our reports functionality and reports are presented at monthly review meetings with corrective action plans agreed for implementation and review. Internal audits will be scheduled throughout the year to assess the effectiveness of our internal systems and void processes.  What measures you will implement to respond to underperformance  Monthly performance monitoring and regular management reviews are carried out to evaluate performance against contract objectives. Performance will be reported monthly to PfH partners and shared with stakeholders. Underperformance rectification will be overseen by the Contracts Manager, with a timescale agreed with the client for this to be achieved.  The outcome will be shared at contract meetings.  Through continuous improvement meetings, we can share our analysis and work together to agree solutions and performance targets.  We also review and reward positive performance, sharing results with our contract colleagues.  How we will test and validate customer requirements during the procurement, at pre-contract stage and during the life of the agreement.  Service reviews will be held quarterly to validate customer requirements. Rosie Hughes, Relationship Manager and our Operations Manager will liaise with key leads to review performance of the contract and to ensure that we are delivering on our client’s aims and objectives.  All members of our operational delivery team will have a responsibility to support continuous improvement in our operational and financial performance through the contract term.'}\n",

MCP adopts the following principles to ensure property turnaround timescales are achieved and we meet our customers’ targets.  This includes having a tailored communication process in place which is crucial in gaining continued support throughout each stage of the contract and making all stakeholders aware of the key objectives and required timescales.  Quality inspections and sign-off processes in place  Our contracts management team will carry out daily quality checks and inspections to ensure high standards of work are being maintained.  All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Contracts Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise.  They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.  A copy of a pre-inspection work survey will be included within job-specific risk assessments and method statements.  We desktop audit 100% of jobs using operative’s notes and condition photos.  We will physically inspect 15% of jobs, or as each contract specification requires.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  Our robust quality management system ensures any defects/snagging issues are identified and rectified as works progress. To reduce the number of defects in works delivered, we aim to achieve first time fix in all jobs and operate a zero defects policy which is communicated to all staff.  Upon completion of works to a property, the Contracts Supervisor will carry out a final ‘snag’ inspection. If any remedial works are required these will be completed.  Once the final inspection is completed the Contract Supervisor will collate all relevant documentation and will compile a completion pack.  Use of directly employed and appropriately skilled resources  Operatives will be assessed against their core competency trade qualifications, with tailored training provided and annual performance appraisals for all staff in the organisation using customer satisfaction feedback and inspection results.  Use of innovative technology to support us with our service delivery  Our works management system, Service Connect incorporates a complete appointment management and dynamic scheduling capability. The scheduling ensures jobs are undertaken in the best sequence taking account of operative’s location, works priority and jeopardy. Our client will have access to real-time information on all open jobs and the status of completions. Everything that is visible to MCP can be visible to our client through a tailored/configured dashboard.  The dashboard highlights any jobs that need attention, for example new jobs or follow-on jobs not appointed, jobs approaching target date etc. It is user-friendly and focuses on key activities (with escalation) that need to be undertaken to ensure that an efficient service is operated. Service Connect’s scheduling and optimising tools ensure that the best suited/located operative is sent to the right appointment as efficiently as possible and provides automated communication with the resident and will match the requirements set out in the contract documents. These tools combine to maximise the first time fix rate and customer satisfaction.  Management / profiling of van stock to maximise operative efficiency  Operatives are provided with branded vans, with full stock, tools and materials appropriate to their role and aligned with our customer’s property specifications. Experience shows that this promotes first time fix and has reduced the need to return with additional materials.  This is further supported through service level agreements with our supplier partners and direct relationships with manufacturers. 93% of jobs are completed from van stock.  Regular monitoring of van stock and material  Service Connect’s technology allows us to share information with our operatives and customers, using vehicle tracking, with integrated stock replenishment and with operatives having the relevant experience and skills to complete the task. This process means that we can deploy suitably equipped operatives timely and efficiently to undertake all elements of the works, whilst having full control over materials availability to ensure quality and reliability.  Service Connect can be tailored to reflect the requirements and agreed standards of each contract. Service Connect, is used to accurately manage our responsive repairs and voids contracts, which enables two-way interface and updates of orders, appointments, variations, events, completions and billing of orders, appointments, etc. Programme tracking throughout the works, including materials with long-lead times  Service Connect captures data on the whole life of each project order to ensure every stage is completed, tracked and transparent - this includes allocating resources and materials required for any particular element, through to operative productivity, subcontractor cost and all the necessary financial management modules and reports. We track live progress and react to issues / delays by carrying out regular audits and surveys of the works in progress.

During mobilisation, we will create a bespoke Resident Communication Strategy, in collaboration with our clients, to agree the methods of communication and frequency/type.  Our residents first approach will mean their involvement in key decisions and enable us to understand their concerns so we can shape their customer journey.  We have a variety of communication methods to ensure we can deliver an inclusive service. We will tailor these methods to the demographics of the community to ensure we reach all residents. Methods include multi-lingual staff, sign language, google translate, photobooks, hard of hearing cards, correspondence in relevant languages. We ensure appointments are made at a time convenient to the resident by: Providing a flexible appointment system for residents based round their personal requirements and circumstances: morning/afternoon/evening/school-run slots Dedicated team of Planners who plan and arrange appointments at the resident’s convenience Work scheduling and appointments operate through our works management system Service Connect Dynamic Scheduling facility Service Connect appointment  On receipt of the call, our team will check the repairs history and confirm the resident’s contact details and raise the repair on Service Connect.  We can offer the next available convenient appointment that the Resident requests.  Remote Assistance is a built-in feature of Service Connect and works by allowing the Planner and Resident to troubleshoot minor issues through live video feed.

Within your response, please address the following points; Leadership and commitment to Net Zero by 2050 Analysis and impact assessment for your organisation (including financial) Planned changes (e.g. sustainable products, supply chains, waste management) Foreseeable impacts for your customers\",  LEADERSHIP & COMMITMENT TO NET ZERO BY 2050: We fully support our customers in achieving their sustainability and environmental commitments and are aware of our responsibilities in achieving zero carbon by 2050. We are proud of our Good Business Charter membership, which demonstrates our commitment in this area. Our positive and proactive approach to delivering a high quality service is guided by our Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Policy which demonstrates our commitment to:  - Reduce carbon emissions - Utilise locally sourced products - Compliance with our ISO14001, ISO9001 and ISO45001 accreditations - Source sustainable products and materials - Minimise waste to landfill - Abide by Regulatory Compliance  Our ESG Policy is reviewed and updated by our CEO Matt Clarke and MD Mark Gelder and driven by the Senior Leadership Team. We have a Sustainability Steering Group, led by our MD, Mark Gelder, who meet once a month to discuss our targets and progress of our Sustainability Action Plan.  Our targets are based on four key themes which are:  THEME 1. IMPROVING THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE WORK FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL WHO LIVE, WORK AND SPEND TIME IN THEM  Targets:  - 1.25% annual turnover invested in our communities - 200 work experience hours a year - Apprentices and trainees represent 10% of our workforce annually - Every employee to have 1 fully paid day’s volunteering – 1,275 number of hours invested annually - Environmental impact assessment and environmental initiatives to form part of our service delivery commitment on every contract  THEME 2. GROWING AND INVESTING IN OUR WORKFORCE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS FIT FOR THE FUTURE  Targets:  - Expand our workforce to 280 by end of 2026 - 100% of tradespeople multi-skilled by end of 2024 - Further investment in Learning and Development to include retrofit upskilling  THEME 3. DEVELOPING A TOTAL PROPERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND USING OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO HELP OUR CLIENTS OPTIMISE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PROPERTIES  Targets: - Achieve client satisfaction score of 98% and Net Promoter Score 9-10 - Increase NPV for clients through the use of Total Property Asset Management Services  THEME 4: BEING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BY OPERATING SUSTAINABLY AND EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A SECTOR-LEADING SERVICE  Targets: - Reduce carbon emissions intensity by 20% by 2030 from a 2022 basesline - Divert 96% of non-hazardous waste from landfill by 2030 - FORS Accreditation by 2023  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS: Our Health & Safety Advisor is responsible for carrying out sustainability impact assessments, monitoring our carbon footprint and the financial impact it has on our business as a whole. Each impact assessment helps us to identify our baseline figures and current costs, allowing us to set targets to be achieved, as part of our sustainability strategy.  For example, we work with Fuelmate who provide us with monthly reports on the volume of fuel used, cost and CO2 usage, this calculates the CO2 emissions created by our vans, through their fuel cards.  PLANNED CHANGES: We are aware of the changing sustainability, energy and quality requirements and standards and recognise the requirement to ensure that the products/materials and components we replace in residents homes are high quality and energy efficient. We work with our key supply chain partners, such as Travis Perkins, to receive regular updates on the use of more sustainable and higher quality materials.  We have a Sustainability Steering Group who meet regularly to oversee our Net Zero Strategy / Sustainable Action Plan. We reinforce our commitment to energy, quality and environmental standards at toolbox talks and contract team meetings, where we discuss with our operatives and subcontractors the changes in legislation and introduction of new materials/products, how their personal contribution can improve the overall customer experience.  Examples of how we have met our existing clients’ energy and quality standards have been summarised below:  ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND COMMITMENT TO ZERO CARBON On every contract we look at ways to reduce our carbon footprint and promote energy efficiency, this has been achieved through:  -  Vans are Euro 6 compliance and emissions standards - Small fleet of hybrid electric vehicles - 2-year replacement cycle on all vehicles to take advantage of new technology - Vehicles are also fitted with trackers, where we analyse journey and driving efficiency - We utilise teleconferencing, MS Teams, Zoom and Facetime to avoid unnecessary travel – utilised more during the Pandemic - Operatives receive their works orders through their smartphone/PDA, enabling more efficient use of time and travel - Installation of automated lighting in our offices - Remote Assist video functionality  as built-in feature of our works management system, Service Connect, so the operative or planner can support a resident and resolve issues, reducing travel and carbon footprint  LOCAL SUPPLY CHAINS We only appoint subcontractor/suppliers who share MCP’s and our customers’ sustainability objectives.  Ensuring they are ISO14001 certified.  WASTE REDUCTION, RECYCLING AND REUSE - Use of biodegradable materials wherever possible and recycle packaging, paint tins, lightbulbs and electrical items (in accordance with WEEE), wood and provide bins on operatives’ vans to sort materials. Liaison with Paint360 where we have looked to use recycled paint and provide a collection point for waste paint and use the resultant recycled paint - All waste disposed of at local waste recycling centres - Monthly waste reporting from our waste management partners to analyse trends and identify areas for improvement - Waste management procedures reinforced through training and toolbox talks - USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS - Supply chain partners supply materials from certified sustainable sources - Value engineering of standard materials with our customers and advise on more energy-efficient - Use materials with minimal plastic packaging  REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION - We have introduced water conservation initiatives and water awareness campaigns to show Residents how they can conserve water in their home   VALUE ENGINEERING OF BETTER QUALITY AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES  - On our Housing for Women contract, we identified the client’s storage heater specification was not energy efficient and was difficult for residents to use.  We worked in collaboration with H4W, submitted a proposal to use a more energy efficient product, which was better quality and easier for the resident to use. We trained the residents on how to operate the new energy-efficient heaters and provided support on managing the timers, which helped with their fuel consumption and saw a reduction in their bills  - Energy-efficient lightbulbs fitted free of charge during repairs - Liaison with external partners to renew instead of replace materials, i.e Crystal Clear Windows to repair instead of replace failed double glazed units in our residents homes - Specified more energy-efficient fittings and fixtures, i.e. low-flow showers and spray head and percussions taps, i.e. flow limiters on taps/showerheads  FORESEEABLE IMPACT FOR CUSTOMERS: We keep updated on climate change through membership of the Green Business Network and Echelon’s best practice and benchmarking club AMIP/CAMIP and attendance at conferences.  By attending these meetings, we gain knowledge of future challenges and impacts and ensure that our organisation can support our customers.  Foreseeable changes can include our approach to the ways in which our products are used, using more energy-efficient products, reducing maintenance costs and supporting customers in rising energy costs.', 'answer': 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY  LEADERSHIP & COMMITMENT TO NET ZERO BY 2050: We fully support our customers in achieving their sustainability and environmental commitments and are aware of our responsibilities in achieving zero carbon by 2050.

Our positive and proactive approach to delivering a high quality service is guided by our Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Policy which demonstrates our commitment to:  - Reduce carbon emissions - Utilise locally sourced products - Compliance with our ISO14001, ISO9001 and ISO45001 accreditations - Source sustainable products and materials - Minimise waste to landfill - Abide by Regulatory Compliance  Our ESG Policy is reviewed and updated by our CEO Matt Clarke and MD Mark Gelder and driven by the Senior Leadership Team. We have a Sustainability Steering Group, led by our MD, Mark Gelder, who meet once a month to discuss our targets and progress of our Sustainability Action Plan.  Our targets are based on four key themes which are:  THEME 1. IMPROVING THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE WORK FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL WHO LIVE, WORK AND SPEND TIME IN THEM  Targets:  - 1.25% annual turnover invested in our communities - 200 work experience hours a year - Apprentices and trainees represent 10% of our workforce annually - Every employee to have 1 fully paid day’s volunteering – 1,275 number of hours invested annually - Environmental impact assessment and environmental initiatives to form part of our service delivery commitment on every contract  THEME 2. GROWING AND INVESTING IN OUR WORKFORCE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS FIT FOR THE FUTURE  Targets:  - Expand our workforce to 280 by end of 2026 - 100% of tradespeople multi-skilled by end of 2024 - Further investment in Learning and Development to include retrofit upskilling  THEME 3. DEVELOPING A TOTAL PROPERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND USING OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO HELP OUR CLIENTS OPTIMISE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PROPERTIES  Targets: - Achieve client satisfaction score of 98% and Net Promoter Score 9-10 - Increase NPV for clients through the use of Total Property Asset Management Services  THEME 4: BEING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BY OPERATING SUSTAINABLY AND EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A SECTOR-LEADING SERVICE  Targets: - Reduce carbon emissions intensity by 20% by 2030 from a 2022 basesline - Divert 96% of non-hazardous waste from landfill by 2030 - FORS Accreditation by 2023  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS: Our Health & Safety Advisor is responsible for carrying out sustainability impact assessments, monitoring our carbon footprint and the financial impact it has on our business as a whole. Each impact assessment helps us to identify our baseline figures and current costs, allowing us to set targets to be achieved, as part of our sustainability strategy.  For example, we work with Fuelmate who provide us with monthly reports on the volume of fuel used, cost and CO2 usage, this calculates the CO2 emissions created by our vans, through their fuel cards.  PLANNED CHANGES: We are aware of the changing sustainability, energy and quality requirements and standards and recognise the requirement to ensure that the products/materials and components we replace in residents homes are high quality and energy efficient. We work with our key supply chain partners, such as Travis Perkins, to receive regular updates on the use of more sustainable and higher quality materials.  We have a Sustainability Steering Group who meet regularly to oversee our Net Zero Strategy / Sustainable Action Plan. We reinforce our commitment to energy, quality and environmental standards at toolbox talks and contract team meetings, where we discuss with our operatives and subcontractors the changes in legislation and introduction of new materials/products, how their personal contribution can improve the overall customer experience.  Examples of how we have met our existing clients’ energy and quality standards have been summarised below:  ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND COMMITMENT TO ZERO CARBON On every contract we look at ways to reduce our carbon footprint and promote energy efficiency, this has been achieved through:  -  Vans are Euro 6 compliance and emissions standards - Small fleet of hybrid electric vehicles - 2-year replacement cycle on all vehicles to take advantage of new technology - Vehicles are also fitted with trackers, where we analyse journey and driving efficiency - We utilise teleconferencing, MS Teams, Zoom and Facetime to avoid unnecessary travel – utilised more during the Pandemic - Operatives receive their works orders through their smartphone/PDA, enabling more efficient use of time and travel - Installation of automated lighting in our offices - Remote Assist video functionality  as built-in feature of our works management system, Service Connect, so the operative or planner can support a resident and resolve issues, reducing travel and carbon footprint  LOCAL SUPPLY CHAINS We only appoint subcontractor/suppliers who share MCP’s and our customers’ sustainability objectives.  Ensuring they are ISO14001 certified.  WASTE REDUCTION, RECYCLING AND REUSE - Use of biodegradable materials wherever possible and recycle packaging, paint tins, lightbulbs and electrical items (in accordance with WEEE), wood and provide bins on operatives’ vans to sort materials. Liaison with Paint360 where we have looked to use recycled paint and provide a collection point for waste paint and use the resultant recycled paint - All waste disposed of at local waste recycling centres - Monthly waste reporting from our waste management partners to analyse trends and identify areas for improvement - Waste management procedures reinforced through training and toolbox talks - USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS - Supply chain partners supply materials from certified sustainable sources - Value engineering of standard materials with our customers and advise on more energy-efficient - Use materials with minimal plastic packaging  REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION - We have introduced water conservation initiatives and water awareness campaigns to show Residents how they can conserve water in their home   VALUE ENGINEERING OF BETTER QUALITY AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES  - On our Housing for Women contract, we identified the client’s storage heater specification was not energy efficient and was difficult for residents to use.  We worked in collaboration with H4W, submitted a proposal to use a more energy efficient product, which was better quality and easier for the resident to use. We trained the residents on how to operate the new energy-efficient heaters and provided support on managing the timers, which helped with their fuel consumption and saw a reduction in their bills  - Energy-efficient lightbulbs fitted free of charge during repairs - Liaison with external partners to renew instead of replace materials, i.e Crystal Clear Windows to repair instead of replace failed double glazed units in our residents homes - Specified more energy-efficient fittings and fixtures, i.e. low-flow showers and spray head and percussions taps, i.e. flow limiters on taps/showerheads  FORESEEABLE IMPACT FOR CUSTOMERS: We keep updated on climate change through membership of the Green Business Network and Echelon’s best practice and benchmarking club AMIP/CAMIP and attendance at conferences.  By attending these meetings, we gain knowledge of future challenges and impacts and ensure that our organisation can support our customers.  Foreseeable changes can include our approach to the ways in which our products are used, using more energy-efficient products, reducing maintenance costs and supporting customers in rising energy costs.'}\n",

Quality requirements and KPI objectives will be communicated to all staff, with regular training provided.  Operations Manager, Leon Ettienne, will be responsible for establishing the report requirements, to reflect the framework requirements and each Member’s specific contractual KPIs, performance and satisfaction management and quality assurance.  The contract specifications and expectations, together with key performance indicators, will form part of our mobilisation workshops in order to understand the targets and standards required. Our QMS processes and procedures have been developed and embedded within our delivery mechanisms and cover:  - monitoring/measurement of product/process - corrective and preventative action - continual improvement - audits - customer satisfaction - control of non-conformance  We will reinforce quality objectives to our workforce and ensure they are aware of expectations. All employees have a responsibility to implement our quality management system. Quality standards and procedures are communicated to operatives and subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.  HOW WE WILL MONITOR AND MANAGE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICE Our management team will use daily quality checks and inspections, ensuring that high standards are being maintained. All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Site Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise. They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.   A copy of a pre-inspection work survey will be included within job-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statements (copy available upon request). 100% of jobs are desk-top audited using operatives notes and condition photos.  We will physically post-inspect 15% of jobs, or as each contract requirement specifies.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  Our robust quality management system ensures any defects/snagging issues are identified and rectified as works progress. To reduce the number of defects in works delivered, we will implement a right first time methodology and operate a zero defects policy which is communicated to all staff. Any defects identified will be rectified immediately to achieve zero defects at handover. Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by the supervisor/finishing foreman to ensure that all quality criteria has been met. Once the Supervisor is satisfied that the work is ready for handover, a Work Completion /  Handover form, together with any relevant certification will be submitted to the Member for acceptance and inspection, together with completion photos and relevant documentation. Rectifying non-conformance – Where the defect may be down to non-conformance, the Contracts Manager is responsible for managing and resolving the issue. Consultation with the Member’s Contracts Administrator to agree the method and timescale for rectification. We would typically treat rectifying non-conformance with an urgent timescale (maximum 3 days) to minimise disruption to the customer. If the non-conformance is a result of a faulty component/product, we will work closely with the manufacturer to schedule an urgent response for rectification. HOW WE WILL REPORT BACK TO MEMBERS.

Regular management reviews will be set to evaluate quality objectives and report on internal quality audits.  How we will monitor and manage quality of our service: Our management team will use daily quality checks and inspections, ensuring that standards are maintained.  For voids and on-off replacement elements we will undertake 100% inspections to ensure the high quality of work is maintained throughout the duration of the contract.  All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Contracts Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise. They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.   A copy of the pre-works survey will be included within job-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statements.  We will monitor and measure the quality of our works on site through carrying out regular quality checks.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  We will use our Works Management System, Service Connect, to record and monitor all work orders, which ensures an audit trail for traceability of workmanship / materials. Connect’s technology allows us to share information with our operatives and customers, using vehicle tracking, with integrated stock replenishment and with operatives having the relevant experience and skills to complete the task. This process means that we can deploy suitably equipped operatives timely and efficiently to undertake all elements of the works, whilst having full control over materials availability to ensure quality and reliability. Service Connect is tailored to our existing Network Homes contract and we will also tailor it to reflect the requirements and agreed standards of this framework.  In real-time, Connect organises the labour resource to achieve all appointments in the most efficient way.  All jobs can be fixed to individual operatives for any reason including safeguarding or where particular skills are needed. If a system event is not met or reacted to, Connect escalates this to the Planner or Supervisor.  If Connect identifies that a job is not likely to be attended as committed, it raises an alert to the Planner and Supervisor and suggests options. In this way we spot and intervene before a job fails, not afterwards when the customer calls to complain.  Van stocks are tailored to the operative’s trade and working geography. All materials used are logged to a job through their PDA which in turn goes to Travis Perkins for the weekly van replenishment visit. Our business analyst monitors materials patterns and visits to merchants to improve van stock profile and increase first time fix. Our operatives also use a WhatsApp Group Forum which enables them to share advice, arrange support and tools, or pass van stock.    Post-works inspections will be carried out by the Contracts Supervisor, with photographs taken of each inspected job and detailed findings recorded on the relevant inspection sheet for subsequent review/action. Inspections are recorded on our system, with monthly trend analysis reports generated and compared to highlight any concerns particularly against repeat issues. Our Contracts Manager Lee will be responsible for reviewing this analysis and reporting outcomes to Network Homes.  Quality feedback is collected from Service Connect and formed into statistical data using our reports functionality and reports are presented at monthly review meetings with corrective action plans agreed for implementation and review.  Quality standards and procedures are communicated to Operatives and Subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.

We will not provide a works completion form forward for inspection by Network Homes until we are certain that it has been completed in accordance with our quality procedures and checklists.

From the outset it is important to have a real and accurate appreciation of the repairs profile and associated materials that will be required for van stock.

They will be responsible for management and performance of Operatives,  void specification, work in progress inspections, post-inspections and Subcontractor management. Each void will have a lead Operative assigned to manage the completion work and quality. They will liaise with the Void Supervisor to organise support or where advice is needed. The lead assigned will always be an MCP direct employee.  Regular and consistent communication will be key to maintaining excellent working relationship with the Sandwell MBC and contract team.  Regular liaison will be maintained with Sandwell’s contract team, updating them on the progress of jobs and notification of any potential issues or any unforeseen circumstances that may have an impact with delivery, to ensure that this can be addressed early.   Our Voids Site Manager will provide weekly reports to Sandwell MBC and maintain regular communication through: Weekly operational meetings to discuss current resources, materials and works progress Monthly continuous improvement meetings to report and measure performance  Please refer to Appendix 3.3 Sandwell Proposed Project Structure which provides the indicative structure.  Contingency Plans - what is in place to maintain service continuity, how staff/supply chain issues managed  In order to maintain service continuity on this contract, we will develop and agree a continuous flow and volume of work from award contract to ensure we maximise the use of resources and deliver best value. We will deliver the works primarily through our specialist subcontractor partners and supported by directly employed operatives to manage any peaks in the programme and compliance requirements.  We will manage our staff and supply chain through forward planning, weekly look-ahead resource meetings and visibility of forecast workload. Where there are sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour absence, we will look to appoint our long established specialist subcontractor partners, who operate across all of our contracts and existing partner in the Sandwell area to provide back-up resources, which will ensure that our service levels can be maintained.  Managing peaks and troughs is a key element in efficient delivery of the voids service; during peak periods, it is essential that turnaround targets continue to be met, whilst maintaining quality.  Resource fluctuations to meet demand will be achieved by:  Using temporary surplus capacity from our other void/planned/responsive contracts Developing a close, continuing supply chain partnership with one or two carefully selected and managed local SME/void subcontractors as agreed  The selection of local SME/void subcontractors, will be approved and evaluated through our robust PAS91 approval process.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are an extension of the MCP family.  We confirm that details of all local SME/subcontractor partners will be shared with Sandwell MBC prior to contract start (during mobilisation  stage).  Resource Allocation - detail how sufficient numbers of suitably qualified personnel will be employed to ensure contracted targets are met  Our intention is to dedicate a flexible core team through the appointment of a combination of directly-employed skilled operatives and subcontractor partners to deliver the works.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are regarded as extended members of the MCP family. Our long-term preferred supply chain partners undergo our strict vetting approval processes and have worked with us for over 20 years so understand our commitment to delivering void refurbishment works within the agreed timescales.  All supply chain partners will work closely with our Operations Manager to discuss any factors which may be affect performance and we work collaboratively to resolving issues.  To accommodate sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour resource we will use a combination of the following methods:  Utilise our specialist supply chain partners who operate across all our contracts, providing back-up resources, ensuring our service level does not drop  Temporarily increase the length of operative’s working day or introduction of shift patterns to ensure flexible resources are maximised  The initial number of resources that we will appoint will be reviewed regularly and will be kept under constant review post the go-live date. Experience has taught us that team continuity is essential for successful contract delivery.  A strategy for working with Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council: On similar contracts we co-locate within our client’s offices which has positive benefits and promotes collaborative working, allowing our team to work close with the client project team promoting a one team ethos.  We will look to propose a similar arrangement on this contract, in agreement with Sandwell.  We will hold regular planning meetings and believe it would be beneficial for Sandwell representatives or the nominated Service Manager to attend these meetings. This approach works well on our Castle Point Borough Council contract, where Client and MCP teams work together to plan, agree realistic timescales, and allocate resources.  Managing resources:  Dependent on the Lot awarded, the dedicated Contracts Manager will review the workload and capacity across the Lotted area. Our Business Intelligence Officer, Tony Wight will keep operative numbers and trade mix under constant review and discuss with Sandwell MBC at contract management and core group meetings. This may lead to more work being undertaken directly.

Key responsibilities will include:  Delivery of services against agreed KPIs Quality and Health & Safety Delivering an exceptional customer experience Returning residents, neighbours and the wider community relationship management     Handover checks undertaken - describe process and provide examples of associated documentation  We will work collaboratively with Sandwell MBC and stakeholders to enable early access and completion of void properties and provide a zero defect handover by regular site inspections, attend housing officer meetings to ensure completed properties are fit for purpose and input into best value practices.   All void properties are inspected throughout the course of the works with detailed inspections completed prior to handover.  Material quality checks will be conducted by the Voids Supervisor. Operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify they are defect-free.  If defect are identified, the materials will be returned to our suppliers.  We formally review defective items with our supply chain partners addressing any common occurrences.  Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by a working foreman/finisher to ensure that all quality criteria has been met.  Once the Voids Supervisor is satisfied that the work is ready for handover, a work completion handover form, together with any relevant certification, will be submitted to Sandwell for approval and inspection.  We will not provide a works completion form to Sandwell until we are certain that it has been completed in accordance with our quality procedures and checklist.  Relevant guarantees/reports are obtained and will be available for joint inspections and completion, ensuring completed properties are fit for purpose.  Acceptance of the works at handover will commence the defects liability period (12 months with all workmanship, in addition to manufacturer warranty periods). We acknowledge that practical completion certificates can sometimes be accompanied by a list of snags/minor defects to be rectified within a specified time period.  Should a defect arise after sign-off / practical completion we will notify Red Kite and our team will carry out an inspection of the defect, determining the cause (i.e. poor workmanship or manufacturer fault).  Following the results of this inspection, a remedial plan will be put in place.  Our operatives will carry out the remedial works and where specialist works or materials are needed, we will mobilise the appropriate subcontractor partner immediately to rectify the defect.  Our resident liaison and feedback process will commence as part of the offering of accompanied visits during the progress of work.  We will obtain preferred contact methods and use this to confirm/clarify any intended residents choice elements.  We will liaise with Sandwell’s Housing Officers, Surveys and incoming residents throughout the works to ensure maximum satisfaction by:  Providing one point of contact and to liaise with new residents Liaising with Housing Officers and surveyors throughout process Providing a completed post inspection report with void handover Providing tailored performance reports for void specific site meetings Providing certification within 24 hours of vacation receipt (CP12, NICEIC, EPC) Weekly informal and monthly formal meetings with Sandwell’s Housing Officers to discuss works progress  Please refer to Appendix 3.

Any laptops that we replace, we will donate these to local families, in collaboration with Network Homes.  We have done this on our Ealing contract and have donated 10 tablets to families.  We will continue to invest in the local community, supporting local charities and reaching out to new partners.  Example: MCP donated Christmas stockings containing socks, gloves, hats, games and sweets to support Herts Young Homeless.  We also We have worked with the Good Things Foundation and Digital Skills Partnership to deliver digital inclusion training to Enfield residents. In 2019, 28 places were funded. Volunteer hours for community projects All MCP employees are actively encouraged to take part in community projects and are awarded one day’s paid leave per year to take part in volunteering, for example to support Network Homes’ Giving Something Extra initiative.  Example: We have held coffee mornings which included an operative attending to carry out minor repairs.  The MCP team also took part in a charity sleepout, which raised £2,600 for Herts Young Homeless Supporting Older People We facilitate events involving older residents and local young people’s services to promote cohesion between generations. Groups meet to share skills and knowledge. In partnership with Enfield and Opening Doors London we developed a network of befriending programmes within the local community to help combat isolation and loneliness. Employment and Skills Training We will participate in local job/school career events to promote apprenticeship opportunities and job vacancies, including attendance at Jobs/Apprenticeships Fairs, assisting with CV writing and job applications (including virtual events). We will be attending an online careers event in Hertford in February. We will hold mock interviews via Zoom/MS Teams, particularly important during lockdown, as some jobseekers may be using online platforms for the first time or have little/no experience of virtual job interviews. We have recently partnered with CTP to offer support to ex-military services personnel with work opportunities. Apprenticeships and Work Placement We will plan for a minimum of 1 apprentice per £500k contract value and have an established Apprentice Academy with a target of 10% of MCP staff undertaking an apprenticeship.  Our successful programme has won several awards, including Hertfordshire Business Awards for Apprenticeships, Supporting Young People.  Our Apprentice Planner Sarah Conran is a finalist in this year’s Apprentice of the Year Award at the NHMF Conference 2021.  We will offer 2 work placements at our Head Office and co-located Network Homes office in Hertford. This will be open to students, NEETS or people wishing to get back into work but lacking relevant experience.'}\n",

Please refer to Appendix 4.1.1a. HFW Mobilisation & Implementation Plan and Appendix 4.1.1b Mobilisation Structure.  MCP has an excellent understanding of the resources, timescales and activities required to ensure a successful contract start.  Over the past year, we have mobilised 10 contracts, this includes during the National Lockdown period, ranging between an annual value of £200,000 to £4.5m, using our tried and tested methods and procedures. We are confident that we can mobilise this contract within 9 weeks as stated in the tender documents and outlined in our Mobilisation Plan.  Upon contract award, we will engage with HFW to set up a kick-off meeting at which we will establish and introduce our dedicated mobilisation team, consisting of key members of the contract delivery and client relationship team and HFW stakeholders who will have direct involvement or influence on the service.  Getting the right people involved from the beginning and communicating early will forge a consistent approach and a real sense of partnering, continuing all the way through the contract.  Key members of the project delivery team will be introduced to build trust, establish relationships and to understand HFW’s key objectives.  To encourage collaborative working and as part of our established mobilisation process, we will organise a series of mobilisation workshops to ensure full understanding of the contract requirements, facilitate wider team relationships and ensure effective understanding of HFW’s expectations. From our experience, these workshops are invaluable in establishing a one team culture and shared vision.  The mobilisation team will have the following objectives:  Introduction and purpose of the contract Develop a full and detailed understanding of the HFW and MCP partnership Identification and mitigation of risk Seamless handover of historic WIP Delivery team development including recruitment and training Technology and IT requirements including integration of systems Communication plans, policies and procedures – including Residents Introduction Packs for the planned works programme Health, safety and environmental procedures integration Social value commitments, agreeing community initiatives and developing a Social Value Plan Supply chain agreements and management Review of KPI requirements and performance management  We recommend that MCP and HFW meet weekly to cover all aspects of the mobilisation process, to ensure that we are prepared and ready for the Contract Start Date of 1st October 2021.  To maintain consistency, our dedicated and experienced mobilisation team will manage the entire mobilisation process and will transition to the contract post go live.  Mobilisation Team  Our Regional Manager, Tom Bullock, will be the main point of contact during mobilisation, between HFW and MCP, with support from our Relationship Manager, Rosie Hughes, who will manage the mobilisation process.  Our dedicated contract delivery team will be involved in the mobilisation process to ensure consistency between mobilisation/implementation and the delivery phase.  We will use the mobilisation phase to develop a positive relationship between all stakeholders and develop a joint vision, values and behaviours charter.  We will establish a culture of collaborative working and problem solving from day one by implementing:  Shared Aims:  From the outset, we will ensure that we regularly analyse ways in which we can improve our systems and processes. Universal Reporting: We will create procedures and reporting methods collaboratively with HFW to meet the operational requirements of the contract Plan Right: During mobilisation, we will meet both existing and potential new supply chain members to check their processes and collaborative working standards align with ours and this will be monitored on an ongoing basis Problem Solving Hierarchy: led by our Regional Manager Tom, we will create a joint process for solving any potential problems with clear steps, named owners and clear escalation  Mobilisation Management  At the initial kick-off meeting, the format of the mobilisation plan will be finalised and key leads will be allocated responsibilities. The primary objective will be to ensure required actions are properly monitored and coordinated to achieve each key stage on the plan.  Actions will be fully detailed on our Mobilisation Action Plan to ensure understanding of both what is required and who is responsible for each specific task.  The Plan will use a RAG (red, amber and green) status colour coding system for each action, so that progress can be clearly seen, and any areas of concern can be readily identified.  At each stage of the mobilisation process, the Mobilisation Action Plan will be updated and circulated to all parties in advance of each weekly meeting, detailing the following aspects:  Summary: Details marked Red, Amber, Green to show status Progress since last update: Details of both actions completed and underway Key activities to be completed: Activities which must be actioned before the next update Critical timeline actions: Specific progress/actions measured against critical milestones  MCP will pay particular attention to risk planning as part of the mobilisation and will develop a formal risk register to ensure reporting on risk elements is a regular feature of monitoring meetings during mobilisation and beyond.  This will be a working document enabling risks/responsibilities to be added at any time.  De-mobilisation of existing services/contracts  Where there may be existing services in place, a phased handover of work between the incumbent contractor and MCP will be agreed with HFW and built into the mobilisation plan to facilitate a smooth transition and assist in avoiding the build-up of incomplete repairs/voids.  We note TUPE will not apply on this contract.  To ensure there is a seamless changeover from the existing service, a number of key lines of communication will be established and managed throughout this process.  This will include reporting on:  Open/outstanding repairs prior to the transfer date of the new contract Delayed start of existing orders and early notification of transfer to MCP Potential early acceptance of an agreed number of new orders by MCP Evaluation of the need for a surge level workforce, which would be provided by our in-house Repairs Support Team (RST), if there is a significant backlog of repairs  MCP can provide a business continuity service in the event of the incumbent contractor’s performance dropping below acceptable levels prior to the go-live date; support will be offered to maintain satisfactory performance with the option to provide an interim parallel service.', 'answer': '4.1.1 Your approach to the mobilisation of the Contract from notification of Contract Award through to works commencing on- site.

Getting the right people involved from the beginning and communicating early will forge a consistent approach and a real sense of partnering, continuing all the way through the contract.  Key members of the project delivery team will be introduced to build trust, establish relationships and to understand HFW’s key objectives.  To encourage collaborative working and as part of our established mobilisation process, we will organise a series of mobilisation workshops to ensure full understanding of the contract requirements, facilitate wider team relationships and ensure effective understanding of HFW’s expectations. From our experience, these workshops are invaluable in establishing a one team culture and shared vision.  The mobilisation team will have the following objectives:  Introduction and purpose of the contract Develop a full and detailed understanding of the HFW and MCP partnership Identification and mitigation of risk Seamless handover of historic WIP Delivery team development including recruitment and training Technology and IT requirements including integration of systems Communication plans, policies and procedures – including Residents Introduction Packs for the planned works programme Health, safety and environmental procedures integration Social value commitments, agreeing community initiatives and developing a Social Value Plan Supply chain agreements and management Review of KPI requirements and performance management  We recommend that MCP and HFW meet weekly to cover all aspects of the mobilisation process, to ensure that we are prepared and ready for the Contract Start Date of 1st October 2021.  To maintain consistency, our dedicated and experienced mobilisation team will manage the entire mobilisation process and will transition to the contract post go live.  Mobilisation Team  Our Regional Manager, Tom Bullock, will be the main point of contact during mobilisation, between HFW and MCP, with support from our Relationship Manager, Rosie Hughes, who will manage the mobilisation process.  Our dedicated contract delivery team will be involved in the mobilisation process to ensure consistency between mobilisation/implementation and the delivery phase.  We will use the mobilisation phase to develop a positive relationship between all stakeholders and develop a joint vision, values and behaviours charter.  We will establish a culture of collaborative working and problem solving from day one by implementing:  Shared Aims:  From the outset, we will ensure that we regularly analyse ways in which we can improve our systems and processes. Universal Reporting: We will create procedures and reporting methods collaboratively with HFW to meet the operational requirements of the contract Plan Right: During mobilisation, we will meet both existing and potential new supply chain members to check their processes and collaborative working standards align with ours and this will be monitored on an ongoing basis Problem Solving Hierarchy: led by our Regional Manager Tom, we will create a joint process for solving any potential problems with clear steps, named owners and clear escalation  Mobilisation Management  At the initial kick-off meeting, the format of the mobilisation plan will be finalised and key leads will be allocated responsibilities. The primary objective will be to ensure required actions are properly monitored and coordinated to achieve each key stage on the plan.  Actions will be fully detailed on our Mobilisation Action Plan to ensure understanding of both what is required and who is responsible for each specific task.  The Plan will use a RAG (red, amber and green) status colour coding system for each action, so that progress can be clearly seen, and any areas of concern can be readily identified.  At each stage of the mobilisation process, the Mobilisation Action Plan will be updated and circulated to all parties in advance of each weekly meeting, detailing the following aspects:  Summary: Details marked Red, Amber, Green to show status Progress since last update: Details of both actions completed and underway Key activities to be completed: Activities which must be actioned before the next update Critical timeline actions: Specific progress/actions measured against critical milestones  MCP will pay particular attention to risk planning as part of the mobilisation and will develop a formal risk register to ensure reporting on risk elements is a regular feature of monitoring meetings during mobilisation and beyond.  This will be a working document enabling risks/responsibilities to be added at any time.  De-mobilisation of existing services/contracts  Where there may be existing services in place, a phased handover of work between the incumbent contractor and MCP will be agreed with HFW and built into the mobilisation plan to facilitate a smooth transition and assist in avoiding the build-up of incomplete repairs/voids.  We note TUPE will not apply on this contract.  To ensure there is a seamless changeover from the existing service, a number of key lines of communication will be established and managed throughout this process.  This will include reporting on:  Open/outstanding repairs prior to the transfer date of the new contract Delayed start of existing orders and early notification of transfer to MCP Potential early acceptance of an agreed number of new orders by MCP Evaluation of the need for a surge level workforce, which would be provided by our in-house Repairs Support Team (RST), if there is a significant backlog of repairs  MCP can provide a business continuity service in the event of the incumbent contractor’s performance dropping below acceptable levels prior to the go-live date; support will be offered to maintain satisfactory performance with the option to provide an interim parallel service.'}\n",

Remote Assistance is a built-in feature of Service Connect and works by allowing the Planner and Resident to troubleshoot minor issues through live video feed. This has helped reduce unnecessary call-outs. We can also offer Active Housing, a self-service customer portal for residents to report and manage their repairs at their convenience, which can be integrated during mobilisation.  Service Connect’s live job management functionality will allow us to record and track the status of each works order via a tailored dashboard configured to Runnymede BC’s specification, the interface allows two-way updates.  Runnymede BC will have remote access to the dashboard and can view all open jobs, live information, photos and satisfaction surveys.  199 words '}\n",

Efficient management of peaks and troughs is a key element in successfully delivering a responsive repairs and voids service and we will deliver the works using a combination of directly employed operatives and our specialist subcontractor partners.   We have a number of approved subcontractors / suppliers, who have worked with MCP for many years and are regarded as extended members of the MCP family.  Our long-term preferred supply chain partners have already undergone a robust PAS91 vetting and approval process.  The vetting process evaluates each subcontractor’s policies/procedures, i.e. quality, environmental and sustainability, health and safety and customer care policies.  We also assess their competency, suitability and commercial resilience to ensure they can meet MCP’s and the contractual requirements.  We also evaluate their previous experience and performance on similar contractors.  Where we have secured contracts in new locations, we aim to source competent, local supplier partners and materials.  Their financial, social and environmental accreditations are evaluated prior to appointment.  As the company grows and expands into new regions, we are strengthening our culture and making sure we are recruiting and retaining the best supply chain partners as well as directly-employed staff.  We engage with our suppliers partner and involve them in our training plans to ensure that we have a steady and stable workforce.  We have service level agreements in place with national suppliers, including Travis Perkins, Jewson and Nichols & Clark.  We only purchase materials that are stated within each contract specification.  During mobilisation, we will work with our supply chain and material partners to create a bespoke product catalogue; a Customer Specific Agreement (CSA), meeting a core range requirement will ensure consistency and value for money.   Material usage is monitored weekly ensuring we have continuous and sufficient supplies.  On our contracts we have a 3-week minimum reserved supply of core and secondary stock, held at our site offices and within our supplier’s branches.  We work with our clients and suppliers to utilise materials/components that provide the most sustainable, lifetime cost.  We meet regularly with our supplier’s Account Managers and trade specialists to review the quality of products and regularly carry out value engineering exercises to ensure we are using the best products available and in some cases, alternative materials have achieved cost savings, whilst being of the same high quality product.  Protocols in place to ensure supply chain resilience, suitability, competence, and standards of work are adhered to.  As part of MCP’s on-boarding process, we look for:  CHAS or Constructionline accredited supply-chain partners Vigorous rounds of meetings going over their capabilities, competence and referencing to their standard of works on past/previous projects  To maintain competent and sustainable supply chain partners, we adopt the principles of the OGC’s Fair Payment Charter, to ensure a process of fair and prompt payment for our subcontractors, reflecting the UK Prompt Payment Code as part of our payment process.  Our procedures ensure our subcontractors are paid in accordance with their agreed terms and conditions. Our prompt payment policy also supports with alleviating cashflow problems.  Percentage and areas of works expected to be sub-contracted On all contracts called off via this framework, our intention would be to appoint a flexible core team of directly employed skilled trades and subcontractor partners to delivery specialist works.  The specialist works include scaffold, asbestos surveying and removal, gas work, FRA works and drainage.  We may also appoint subcontractor partners to accommodate sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour resource.  The initial number of resources that we will appoint will be dependent on each contract and will be reviewed regularly.  Monitoring, validation, and mitigation of quality and price fluctuation.  MCP openly has dialogue around cost certainty at the time of on-boarding a supply-chain partner. At this point, supply chain price agreements are always based on the current and the next 12-months.  We only engage with, and ensure any supply chain partner on-boarded, is fully versed on the contract model, being open and transparent on how best price fluctuations are mitigated internally. Our approach in price fluctuations is that it should be dealt with-in the commercial model of a contract, and it must be something extremely drastic to open a potential conversation with the client.  Our approach to overcoming resulting programme/delivery pressures.  We take a proactive approach in holding regular internal and external meetings with all stakeholders.  This approach has proven successful on numerous planned projects, as well as our responsive maintenance void delivery services.  We aim to minimise the risk of delivery pressures through forward planning, weekly look-ahead resource meetings and visibility of forecast workload.  Our collaborative nature to liaise with our clients and all stakeholders as often as is needed, structured meetings with shared notes and actions, ensuring a proactive approach is the mind-set at the forefront of our delivery.  How we ensure on-time/responsive delivery  We make the key performance indicators visible and transparent and linked to the key deliverables of the contract, ensuring any new supply chain member / subcontractor is approved and aware of this.  We regularly monitor and hold contractor performance reviews where any impact to service delivery is captured stages before any implications to our clients.  We take proactive approaches in holding necessary, internal, and external meetings with all stakeholders.

       "  'answer': 'Ensuring a sustainable supply chain (labour and materials) to ensure works deliverables are met at all times.  We will develop and agree a continuous flow and volume of work from contract award to ensure we maximise the use of resources and deliver best value. Efficient management of peaks and troughs is a key element in successfully delivering a responsive repairs and voids service and we will deliver the works using a combination of directly employed operatives and our specialist subcontractor partners.   We have a number of approved subcontractors / suppliers, who have worked with MCP for many years and are regarded as extended members of the MCP family.  Our long-term preferred supply chain partners have already undergone a robust PAS91 vetting and approval process.  The vetting process evaluates each subcontractor’s policies/procedures, i.e. quality, environmental and sustainability, health and safety and customer care policies.  We also assess their competency, suitability and commercial resilience to ensure they can meet MCP’s and the contractual requirements.  We also evaluate their previous experience and performance on similar contractors.  Where we have secured contracts in new locations, we aim to source competent, local supplier partners and materials.  Their financial, social and environmental accreditations are evaluated prior to appointment.  As the company grows and expands into new regions, we are strengthening our culture and making sure we are recruiting and retaining the best supply chain partners as well as directly-employed staff.  We engage with our suppliers partner and involve them in our training plans to ensure that we have a steady and stable workforce.  We have service level agreements in place with national suppliers, including Travis Perkins, Jewson and Nichols & Clark.  We only purchase materials that are stated within each contract specification.  During mobilisation, we will work with our supply chain and material partners to create a bespoke product catalogue; a Customer Specific Agreement (CSA), meeting a core range requirement will ensure consistency and value for money.   Material usage is monitored weekly ensuring we have continuous and sufficient supplies.  On our contracts we have a 3-week minimum reserved supply of core and secondary stock, held at our site offices and within our supplier’s branches.  We work with our clients and suppliers to utilise materials/components that provide the most sustainable, lifetime cost.  We meet regularly with our supplier’s Account Managers and trade specialists to review the quality of products and regularly carry out value engineering exercises to ensure we are using the best products available and in some cases, alternative materials have achieved cost savings, whilst being of the same high quality product.  Protocols in place to ensure supply chain resilience, suitability, competence, and standards of work are adhered to.  As part of MCP’s on-boarding process, we look for:  CHAS or Constructionline accredited supply-chain partners Vigorous rounds of meetings going over their capabilities, competence and referencing to their standard of works on past/previous projects  To maintain competent and sustainable supply chain partners, we adopt the principles of the OGC’s Fair Payment Charter, to ensure a process of fair and prompt payment for our subcontractors, reflecting the UK Prompt Payment Code as part of our payment process.  Our procedures ensure our subcontractors are paid in accordance with their agreed terms and conditions. Our prompt payment policy also supports with alleviating cashflow problems.  Percentage and areas of works expected to be sub-contracted On all contracts called off via this framework, our intention would be to appoint a flexible core team of directly employed skilled trades and subcontractor partners to delivery specialist works.  The specialist works include scaffold, asbestos surveying and removal, gas work, FRA works and drainage.  We may also appoint subcontractor partners to accommodate sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour resource.  The initial number of resources that we will appoint will be dependent on each contract and will be reviewed regularly.  Monitoring, validation, and mitigation of quality and price fluctuation.  MCP openly has dialogue around cost certainty at the time of on-boarding a supply-chain partner. At this point, supply chain price agreements are always based on the current and the next 12-months.  We only engage with, and ensure any supply chain partner on-boarded, is fully versed on the contract model, being open and transparent on how best price fluctuations are mitigated internally. Our approach in price fluctuations is that it should be dealt with-in the commercial model of a contract, and it must be something extremely drastic to open a potential conversation with the client.  Our approach to overcoming resulting programme/delivery pressures.  We take a proactive approach in holding regular internal and external meetings with all stakeholders.  This approach has proven successful on numerous planned projects, as well as our responsive maintenance void delivery services.  We aim to minimise the risk of delivery pressures through forward planning, weekly look-ahead resource meetings and visibility of forecast workload.  Our collaborative nature to liaise with our clients and all stakeholders as often as is needed, structured meetings with shared notes and actions, ensuring a proactive approach is the mind-set at the forefront of our delivery.  How we ensure on-time/responsive delivery  We make the key performance indicators visible and transparent and linked to the key deliverables of the contract, ensuring any new supply chain member / subcontractor is approved and aware of this.  We regularly monitor and hold contractor performance reviews where any impact to service delivery is captured stages before any implications to our clients.  We take proactive approaches in holding necessary, internal, and external meetings with all stakeholders.

MCP adopts the following principles to ensure property turnaround timescales are achieved and we meet our customers’ targets.  This includes having a tailored communication process in place which is crucial in gaining continued support throughout each stage of the contract and making all stakeholders aware of the key objectives and required timescales.  Quality inspections and sign-off processes in place  Our contracts management team will carry out daily quality checks and inspections to ensure high standards of work are being maintained.  All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Contracts Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise.  They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.  A copy of a pre-inspection work survey will be included within job-specific risk assessments and method statements.  We desktop audit 100% of jobs using operative’s notes and condition photos.  We will physically inspect 15% of jobs, or as each contract specification requires.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  Our robust quality management system ensures any defects/snagging issues are identified and rectified as works progress. To reduce the number of defects in works delivered, we aim to achieve first time fix in all jobs and operate a zero defects policy which is communicated to all staff.  Upon completion of works to a property, the Contracts Supervisor will carry out a final ‘snag’ inspection. If any remedial works are required these will be completed.  Once the final inspection is completed the Contract Supervisor will collate all relevant documentation and will compile a completion pack.  Use of directly employed and appropriately skilled resources  Operatives will be assessed against their core competency trade qualifications, with tailored training provided and annual performance appraisals for all staff in the organisation using customer satisfaction feedback and inspection results.  Use of innovative technology to support us with our service delivery  Our works management system, Service Connect incorporates a complete appointment management and dynamic scheduling capability. The scheduling ensures jobs are undertaken in the best sequence taking account of operative’s location, works priority and jeopardy. Our client will have access to real-time information on all open jobs and the status of completions. Everything that is visible to MCP can be visible to our client through a tailored/configured dashboard.  The dashboard highlights any jobs that need attention, for example new jobs or follow-on jobs not appointed, jobs approaching target date etc. It is user-friendly and focuses on key activities (with escalation) that need to be undertaken to ensure that an efficient service is operated. Service Connect’s scheduling and optimising tools ensure that the best suited/located operative is sent to the right appointment as efficiently as possible and provides automated communication with the resident and will match the requirements set out in the contract documents. These tools combine to maximise the first time fix rate and customer satisfaction.  Management / profiling of van stock to maximise operative efficiency  Operatives are provided with branded vans, with full stock, tools and materials appropriate to their role and aligned with our customer’s property specifications. Experience shows that this promotes first time fix and has reduced the need to return with additional materials.  This is further supported through service level agreements with our supplier partners and direct relationships with manufacturers. 93% of jobs are completed from van stock.  Regular monitoring of van stock and material  Service Connect’s technology allows us to share information with our operatives and customers, using vehicle tracking, with integrated stock replenishment and with operatives having the relevant experience and skills to complete the task. This process means that we can deploy suitably equipped operatives timely and efficiently to undertake all elements of the works, whilst having full control over materials availability to ensure quality and reliability.

All contracts awarded under this framework will be managed and delivered in compliance with our Quality Management System (QMS) which is accredited to ISO9001:2015.  Quality requirements and KPI objectives will be communicated to all staff, with regular training provided.  Operations Manager, Leon Ettienne, will be responsible for establishing the report requirements, to reflect the framework requirements and each Member’s specific contractual KPIs, performance and satisfaction management and quality assurance.  The contract specifications and expectations, together with key performance indicators, will form part of our mobilisation workshops in order to understand the targets and standards required. Our QMS processes and procedures have been developed and embedded within our delivery mechanisms and cover:  - monitoring/measurement of product/process - corrective and preventative action - continual improvement - audits - customer satisfaction - control of non-conformance  We will reinforce quality objectives to our workforce and ensure they are aware of expectations. All employees have a responsibility to implement our quality management system. Quality standards and procedures are communicated to operatives and subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.  HOW WE WILL MONITOR AND MANAGE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICE Our management team will use daily quality checks and inspections, ensuring that high standards are being maintained. All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Site Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise. They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.   A copy of a pre-inspection work survey will be included within job-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statements (copy available upon request). 100% of jobs are desk-top audited using operatives notes and condition photos.  We will physically post-inspect 15% of jobs, or as each contract requirement specifies.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  Our robust quality management system ensures any defects/snagging issues are identified and rectified as works progress. To reduce the number of defects in works delivered, we will implement a right first time methodology and operate a zero defects policy which is communicated to all staff. Any defects identified will be rectified immediately to achieve zero defects at handover. Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by the supervisor/finishing foreman to ensure that all quality criteria has been met. Once the Supervisor is satisfied that the work is ready for handover, a Work Completion /  Handover form, together with any relevant certification will be submitted to the Member for acceptance and inspection, together with completion photos and relevant documentation. Rectifying non-conformance – Where the defect may be down to non-conformance, the Contracts Manager is responsible for managing and resolving the issue. Consultation with the Member’s Contracts Administrator to agree the method and timescale for rectification. We would typically treat rectifying non-conformance with an urgent timescale (maximum 3 days) to minimise disruption to the customer. If the non-conformance is a result of a faulty component/product, we will work closely with the manufacturer to schedule an urgent response for rectification. HOW WE WILL REPORT BACK TO MEMBERS. Performance will is reported monthly to Members and shared with stakeholders. All Inspections are recorded on our system, with monthly trend analysis reports generated and compared to highlight any concerns particularly against repeat issues. The Contracts Manager is responsible for reviewing this analysis and reporting outcomes to Members. Quality feedback is collected from our works management system and formed into statistical data using our reports functionality and reports are presented at monthly review meetings with corrective action plans agreed for implementation and review.  Quality standards and procedures are communicated to Operatives and Subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.The contract team conduct daily briefings, to ensure all works planned for that day have been completed in accordance with the programme of works.  We review the work for the following day to ensure adequate resources are in place. APPROACH TO DAY-TO-DAY CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. A dedicated Contracts Manager will be assigned to each contract, responsible for the day-to-day management and is responsible for monitoring and measuring the quality of our works on site through carrying out regular quality checks, in accordance with contract-specific quality plans, to ensure high standards.  The quality plans are agreed with Members during mobilisation. All operatives will be trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately. From the outset, we include toolbox talks on quality and product training highlighting material defect issues. Our controls incorporate proper, regular and recorded inspections carried out on our operative’s behaviour and the work they produce. Customer satisfaction surveys will be undertaken post completion to include both telephone and questionnaire survey.  Reviews of complaints, compliments and comments will be undertaken, in line with our robust complaints process. As part of the job completion process, we will obtain a client sign-off for completed works, as agreed. At the pre-arranged handover meeting with the client, we will have a multi-trade operative available to complete any minor modifications at the time.Our inspection processes consider both the physical quality of the work, together with feedback from the resident; by reviewing this data, together with other indicators, we are able to quickly focus on and respond to problematic areas – thereby improving quality satisfaction with our services. Quality feedback will be collected from our works management system and formed into statistical data using our reports functionality and reports are presented at monthly review meetings with corrective action plans agreed for implementation and review. Internal audits will be scheduled throughout the year to assess the effectiveness of our internal systems and void processes. THE MEASURES IN PLACE TO ENABLE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGE PERFORMANCE To ensure continuous improvement throughout our contracts, the following methods will be used to control and monitor quality of service: - Contracts Supervisor undertakes quality of work inspections, together with resident satisfaction surveys - Post-work inspections by Contract Manager/Supervisor; photographs taken of each inspected job and details of findings recorded on the relevant inspection sheet for subsequent review/action - Internal safety audits by Health & Safety Advisor - Scheduled quality audits throughout the year to assess/resolve the effectiveness of our ISO9001, 14001 and 45001 systems and processes and can be issued to Members - Resident satisfaction; undertaken to include both telephone and resident satisfaction surveys - Staff Skills and Aspirations appraisals targeted to enhance delivery of both quality and customer care - Supervisor joint visit/job shadowing for each operative as part of their induction - Continuous Improvement workshops',\n",
       "  'answer': 'OUR APPROACH TO MONITORING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT We recognise the importance of completing works to a high standard in order to ensure increased resident satisfaction. All contracts awarded under this framework will be managed and delivered in compliance with our Quality Management System (QMS) which is accredited to ISO9001:2015.  Quality requirements and KPI objectives will be communicated to all staff, with regular training provided.  Operations Manager, Leon Ettienne, will be responsible for establishing the report requirements, to reflect the framework requirements and each Member’s specific contractual KPIs, performance and satisfaction management and quality assurance.  The contract specifications and expectations, together with key performance indicators, will form part of our mobilisation workshops in order to understand the targets and standards required. Our QMS processes and procedures have been developed and embedded within our delivery mechanisms and cover:  - monitoring/measurement of product/process - corrective and preventative action - continual improvement - audits - customer satisfaction - control of non-conformance  We will reinforce quality objectives to our workforce and ensure they are aware of expectations. All employees have a responsibility to implement our quality management system. Quality standards and procedures are communicated to operatives and subcontractors through site inductions and reinforced via on-site supervision, quality control checks and toolbox talks.  HOW WE WILL MONITOR AND MANAGE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICE Our management team will use daily quality checks and inspections, ensuring that high standards are being maintained. All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Site Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise. They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.   A copy of a pre-inspection work survey will be included within job-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statements (copy available upon request). 100% of jobs are desk-top audited using operatives notes and condition photos.  We will physically post-inspect 15% of jobs, or as each contract requirement specifies.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  Our robust quality management system ensures any defects/snagging issues are identified and rectified as works progress. To reduce the number of defects in works delivered, we will implement a right first time methodology and operate a zero defects policy which is communicated to all staff. Any defects identified will be rectified immediately to achieve zero defects at handover. Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by the supervisor/finishing foreman to ensure that all quality criteria has been met.

Example: At Christian Action Housing Association, this approach has increased efficiency and minimises disruption for residents/staff within sheltered accommodation due to reduction in repeat visits  Added Benefit for Residents: MCP are continuously looking at ways to improve our services, working with our Clients to provide a tailored and inclusive service that reaches every resident to reduce the disruption that our works inevitably cause. MCP have been delivering responsive repairs and void works for Network Homes since 2005, servicing approximately 6,700 homes. Through this collaborative working, we have been able to introduce a number of Examples include:  Utilisation of the Self-service repair reporting tool,  allows Residents to report repairs, change appointments and track progress at their convenience, rather than spend time making calls (see Pic.1). Remote Assist Video Technology enable call-handlers to diagnose repairs with Residents through self-help videos (see Pic.2).  We have been able to reduce unnecessary repair visits by 10%, improve First Time Fix by 5%. This has been particularly valuable during the Coronavirus pandemic for vulnerable / shielding Residents.   all works are undertaken efficiently, completed on time, evidenced and checked within costs Lee Fensome, Contracts Manager will have overall responsibility for timely cost control and programme management, using our in-house Works Management System Service Connect to monitor and manage projects. Costs are monitored with the Contract Supervisor from inspection to completion, ensuring consistency; these will be highlighted during meetings with Network Homes, particularly where adjustments made (both additions and deductions) could impact on the overall programme / budget cost. Each project undergoes a commercial review prior to final invoicing to ensure ease of sign off.   The commercial review will ensure accurate valuations of both completed work and accurate forecasts of jobs in progress.  Service Connect comprehensively monitors all work orders, from logging to completion, collating reports on individual order costing, subcontractors, labour rates / hours and materials / components and plant used.  We will capture and report on all cost data and use an automated report for monthly forecasts and budget management.  We will ensure that works are undertaken efficiently by appointing competent resources.  Operatives will be assessed against their core competency trade qualifications, prior to completing a two-week job shadowing process.  Tailored training will be provided, including Equality and Diversity, Safeguarding / Vulnerable Persons.  Annual performance appraisals for all staff in the organisation are carried out, using customer satisfaction feedback and inspection results.  Subcontractor partners will be appointed for availability during peak periods. We will produce programmes giving individual trades a steady / consistent workload, eliminating risk of resources not being available, subsequently delaying works and impacting the programme.  If you are unable to deliver against any of the above how will you communicate this to Network Homes Regular and consistent communication will be key between our delivery team and Network Homes throughout each contract.  On every contract, our Contract Supervisor will be responsible for monitoring the day-to-day progress of the contract.  Weekly site meetings will be held with the delivery team and we will track live progress and react to issues which could potentially affect delivery of the contract by carrying out regular audits and surveys of works in progress.  We will hold monthly budget/programme reviews with Network Homes where actual progress will be measured against the programme.  At these meetings we will discuss issues that could potentially impact on the overall programme of works, e.g., labour resources, cost, and access/material deliveries.  This will ensure that mitigation plans can be put in place to address the issues collaboratively, as one team.

This approach will increase efficiency and minimise disruption for residents reducing the number of repeat visits.  that there is minimum disruption to residents We will implement the following procedures on every contract to ensure disruption is minimised: Key point of contact for the Resident, through a dedicated Resident Liaison Officer Residents will have access to our self-service Repairs Reporting Tool Operatives are trained in Customer Care, compliance with MCP’s Code of Conduct/Customer Care Policy.  Also trained in safeguarding and working with vulnerable residents Multi-skilled directly employed workforce, working with Network Homes we will match our resources to meet demand of each project, by building an accurate understanding of repair types and frequency Flexible appointments recognising Residents routines/unique requirements, through resident profiling, planning our activities around their personal requirements and schedules Creation of optimised delivery programmes, monitoring and reporting on progress to ensure appointments made are kept 98% average being achieved across our contracts Early and regular engagement with residents, keeping residents fully informed/up-to-date, how long the work will take, avoiding a recall/second visit (average 95% first time fix achieved across our contracts) Protecting resident’s home/belongings ensuring areas of work are clean, with minimal noise and inconvenience and removal of rubbish/debris before leaving Resident’s dedicated key point of contact, through Supervisors/Resident Liaison Officers Access to Customer Service Team for enquiries who use Service Connect Operatives carry van stocks of materials and PPE tailored to Client properties, promoting high first time fix, reduces return visits and Planned ‘repair days’ multiple repairs completed across several individual homes/ communal areas. Example: At Christian Action Housing Association, this approach has increased efficiency and minimises disruption for residents/staff within sheltered accommodation due to reduction in repeat visits  Added Benefit for Residents: MCP are continuously looking at ways to improve our services, working with our Clients to provide a tailored and inclusive service that reaches every resident to reduce the disruption that our works inevitably cause. MCP have been delivering responsive repairs and void works for Network Homes since 2005, servicing approximately 6,700 homes. Through this collaborative working, we have been able to introduce a number of Examples include:  Utilisation of the Self-service repair reporting tool,  allows Residents to report repairs, change appointments and track progress at their convenience, rather than spend time making calls (see Pic.1). Remote Assist Video Technology enable call-handlers to diagnose repairs with Residents through self-help videos (see Pic.2).  We have been able to reduce unnecessary repair visits by 10%, improve First Time Fix by 5%. This has been particularly valuable during the Coronavirus pandemic for vulnerable / shielding Residents.   all works are undertaken efficiently, completed on time, evidenced and checked within costs Lee Fensome, Contracts Manager will have overall responsibility for timely cost control and programme management, using our in-house Works Management System Service Connect to monitor and manage projects. Costs are monitored with the Contract Supervisor from inspection to completion, ensuring consistency; these will be highlighted during meetings with Network Homes, particularly where adjustments made (both additions and deductions) could impact on the overall programme / budget cost. Each project undergoes a commercial review prior to final invoicing to ensure ease of sign off.   The commercial review will ensure accurate valuations of both completed work and accurate forecasts of jobs in progress.  Service Connect comprehensively monitors all work orders, from logging to completion, collating reports on individual order costing, subcontractors, labour rates / hours and materials / components and plant used.  We will capture and report on all cost data and use an automated report for monthly forecasts and budget management.  We will ensure that works are undertaken efficiently by appointing competent resources.  Operatives will be assessed against their core competency trade qualifications, prior to completing a two-week job shadowing process.  Tailored training will be provided, including Equality and Diversity, Safeguarding / Vulnerable Persons.  Annual performance appraisals for all staff in the organisation are carried out, using customer satisfaction feedback and inspection results.  Subcontractor partners will be appointed for availability during peak periods. We will produce programmes giving individual trades a steady / consistent workload, eliminating risk of resources not being available, subsequently delaying works and impacting the programme.  If you are unable to deliver against any of the above how will you communicate this to Network Homes Regular and consistent communication will be key between our delivery team and Network Homes throughout each contract.  On every contract, our Contract Supervisor will be responsible for monitoring the day-to-day progress of the contract.  Weekly site meetings will be held with the delivery team and we will track live progress and react to issues which could potentially affect delivery of the contract by carrying out regular audits and surveys of works in progress.  We will hold monthly budget/programme reviews with Network Homes where actual progress will be measured against the programme.  At these meetings we will discuss issues that could potentially impact on the overall programme of works, e.g., labour resources, cost, and access/material deliveries.  This will ensure that mitigation plans can be put in place to address the issues collaboratively, as one team.  Our Contracts Manager will maintain regular liaison with Network Homes representatives to ensure that any unforeseen circumstances which may have an impact with delivery can be addressed early.

Regular management reviews will be set to evaluate quality objectives and report on internal quality audits.  How we will monitor and manage quality of our service: Our management team will use daily quality checks and inspections, ensuring that standards are maintained.  For voids and on-off replacement elements we will undertake 100% inspections to ensure the high quality of work is maintained throughout the duration of the contract.  All works will be pre-inspected and overseen by a dedicated Contracts Supervisor who will confirm the scope of works provided, validate quantities, identify any variations and/or potential variations that may arise. They will also assess the works and identify any perceived risks to be mitigated prior to the commencement of works.   A copy of the pre-works survey will be included within job-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statements.  We will monitor and measure the quality of our works on site through carrying out regular quality checks.  All operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify that they are defect free. If defects are identified, it will be addressed and rectified immediately.  We will use our Works Management System, Service Connect, to record and monitor all work orders, which ensures an audit trail for traceability of workmanship / materials. Connect’s technology allows us to share information with our operatives and customers, using vehicle tracking, with integrated stock replenishment and with operatives having the relevant experience and skills to complete the task. This process means that we can deploy suitably equipped operatives timely and efficiently to undertake all elements of the works, whilst having full control over materials availability to ensure quality and reliability. Service Connect is tailored to our existing Network Homes contract and we will also tailor it to reflect the requirements and agreed standards of this framework.  In real-time, Connect organises the labour resource to achieve all appointments in the most efficient way.  All jobs can be fixed to individual operatives for any reason including safeguarding or where particular skills are needed. If a system event is not met or reacted to, Connect escalates this to the Planner or Supervisor.  If Connect identifies that a job is not likely to be attended as committed, it raises an alert to the Planner and Supervisor and suggests options. In this way we spot and intervene before a job fails, not afterwards when the customer calls to complain.  Van stocks are tailored to the operative’s trade and working geography. All materials used are logged to a job through their PDA which in turn goes to Travis Perkins for the weekly van replenishment visit. Our business analyst monitors materials patterns and visits to merchants to improve van stock profile and increase first time fix. Our operatives also use a WhatsApp Group Forum which enables them to share advice, arrange support and tools, or pass van stock.    Post-works inspections will be carried out by the Contracts Supervisor, with photographs taken of each inspected job and detailed findings recorded on the relevant inspection sheet for subsequent review/action. Inspections are recorded on our system, with monthly trend analysis reports generated and compared to highlight any concerns particularly against repeat issues. Our Contracts Manager Lee will be responsible for reviewing this analysis and reporting outcomes to Network Homes.

Our Voids Site Manager will provide weekly reports to Sandwell MBC and maintain regular communication through: Weekly operational meetings to discuss current resources, materials and works progress Monthly continuous improvement meetings to report and measure performance  Please refer to Appendix 3.3 Sandwell Proposed Project Structure which provides the indicative structure.  Contingency Plans - what is in place to maintain service continuity, how staff/supply chain issues managed  In order to maintain service continuity on this contract, we will develop and agree a continuous flow and volume of work from award contract to ensure we maximise the use of resources and deliver best value. We will deliver the works primarily through our specialist subcontractor partners and supported by directly employed operatives to manage any peaks in the programme and compliance requirements.  We will manage our staff and supply chain through forward planning, weekly look-ahead resource meetings and visibility of forecast workload. Where there are sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour absence, we will look to appoint our long established specialist subcontractor partners, who operate across all of our contracts and existing partner in the Sandwell area to provide back-up resources, which will ensure that our service levels can be maintained.  Managing peaks and troughs is a key element in efficient delivery of the voids service; during peak periods, it is essential that turnaround targets continue to be met, whilst maintaining quality.  Resource fluctuations to meet demand will be achieved by:  Using temporary surplus capacity from our other void/planned/responsive contracts Developing a close, continuing supply chain partnership with one or two carefully selected and managed local SME/void subcontractors as agreed  The selection of local SME/void subcontractors, will be approved and evaluated through our robust PAS91 approval process.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are an extension of the MCP family.  We confirm that details of all local SME/subcontractor partners will be shared with Sandwell MBC prior to contract start (during mobilisation  stage).  Resource Allocation - detail how sufficient numbers of suitably qualified personnel will be employed to ensure contracted targets are met  Our intention is to dedicate a flexible core team through the appointment of a combination of directly-employed skilled operatives and subcontractor partners to deliver the works.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are regarded as extended members of the MCP family. Our long-term preferred supply chain partners undergo our strict vetting approval processes and have worked with us for over 20 years so understand our commitment to delivering void refurbishment works within the agreed timescales.  All supply chain partners will work closely with our Operations Manager to discuss any factors which may be affect performance and we work collaboratively to resolving issues.  To accommodate sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour resource we will use a combination of the following methods:  Utilise our specialist supply chain partners who operate across all our contracts, providing back-up resources, ensuring our service level does not drop  Temporarily increase the length of operative’s working day or introduction of shift patterns to ensure flexible resources are maximised  The initial number of resources that we will appoint will be reviewed regularly and will be kept under constant review post the go-live date. Experience has taught us that team continuity is essential for successful contract delivery.  A strategy for working with Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council: On similar contracts we co-locate within our client’s offices which has positive benefits and promotes collaborative working, allowing our team to work close with the client project team promoting a one team ethos.  We will look to propose a similar arrangement on this contract, in agreement with Sandwell.  We will hold regular planning meetings and believe it would be beneficial for Sandwell representatives or the nominated Service Manager to attend these meetings. This approach works well on our Castle Point Borough Council contract, where Client and MCP teams work together to plan, agree realistic timescales, and allocate resources.  Managing resources:  Dependent on the Lot awarded, the dedicated Contracts Manager will review the workload and capacity across the Lotted area. Our Business Intelligence Officer, Tony Wight will keep operative numbers and trade mix under constant review and discuss with Sandwell MBC at contract management and core group meetings. This may lead to more work being undertaken directly. Our Voids Planning Team will work across all services with the key responsibilities of:  Scheduling of resources efficiently Identifying efficiencies in service delivery Ensuring capacity meets demand Day-to-day monitoring of delivery Monitoring and reporting against service delivery KPIs  Our teams will be focused on delivering the voids and post tenancy service to your residents.  Key responsibilities will include:  Delivery of services against agreed KPIs Quality and Health & Safety Delivering an exceptional customer experience Returning residents, neighbours and the wider community relationship management     Handover checks undertaken - describe process and provide examples of associated documentation  We will work collaboratively with Sandwell MBC and stakeholders to enable early access and completion of void properties and provide a zero defect handover by regular site inspections, attend housing officer meetings to ensure completed properties are fit for purpose and input into best value practices.   All void properties are inspected throughout the course of the works with detailed inspections completed prior to handover.  Material quality checks will be conducted by the Voids Supervisor. Operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify they are defect-free.  If defect are identified, the materials will be returned to our suppliers.  We formally review defective items with our supply chain partners addressing any common occurrences.  Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by a working foreman/finisher to ensure that all quality criteria has been met.  Once the Voids Supervisor is satisfied that the work is ready for handover, a work completion handover form, together with any relevant certification, will be submitted to Sandwell for approval and inspection.  We will not provide a works completion form to Sandwell until we are certain that it has been completed in accordance with our quality procedures and checklist.  Relevant guarantees/reports are obtained and will be available for joint inspections and completion, ensuring completed properties are fit for purpose.  Acceptance of the works at handover will commence the defects liability period (12 months with all workmanship, in addition to manufacturer warranty periods). We acknowledge that practical completion certificates can sometimes be accompanied by a list of snags/minor defects to be rectified within a specified time period.  Should a defect arise after sign-off / practical completion we will notify Red Kite and our team will carry out an inspection of the defect, determining the cause (i.e. poor workmanship or manufacturer fault).  Following the results of this inspection, a remedial plan will be put in place.  Our operatives will carry out the remedial works and where specialist works or materials are needed, we will mobilise the appropriate subcontractor partner immediately to rectify the defect.  Our resident liaison and feedback process will commence as part of the offering of accompanied visits during the progress of work.  We will obtain preferred contact methods and use this to confirm/clarify any intended residents choice elements.  We will liaise with Sandwell’s Housing Officers, Surveys and incoming residents throughout the works to ensure maximum satisfaction by:  Providing one point of contact and to liaise with new residents Liaising with Housing Officers and surveyors throughout process Providing a completed post inspection report with void handover Providing tailored performance reports for void specific site meetings Providing certification within 24 hours of vacation receipt (CP12, NICEIC, EPC) Weekly informal and monthly formal meetings with Sandwell’s Housing Officers to discuss works progress  Please refer to Appendix 3.

Where there are sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour absence, we will look to appoint our long established specialist subcontractor partners, who operate across all of our contracts and existing partner in the Sandwell area to provide back-up resources, which will ensure that our service levels can be maintained.  Managing peaks and troughs is a key element in efficient delivery of the voids service; during peak periods, it is essential that turnaround targets continue to be met, whilst maintaining quality.  Resource fluctuations to meet demand will be achieved by:  Using temporary surplus capacity from our other void/planned/responsive contracts Developing a close, continuing supply chain partnership with one or two carefully selected and managed local SME/void subcontractors as agreed  The selection of local SME/void subcontractors, will be approved and evaluated through our robust PAS91 approval process.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are an extension of the MCP family.  We confirm that details of all local SME/subcontractor partners will be shared with Sandwell MBC prior to contract start (during mobilisation  stage).  Resource Allocation - detail how sufficient numbers of suitably qualified personnel will be employed to ensure contracted targets are met  Our intention is to dedicate a flexible core team through the appointment of a combination of directly-employed skilled operatives and subcontractor partners to deliver the works.  We have a number of approved subcontractors/suppliers who have worked with MCP for many years and are regarded as extended members of the MCP family. Our long-term preferred supply chain partners undergo our strict vetting approval processes and have worked with us for over 20 years so understand our commitment to delivering void refurbishment works within the agreed timescales.  All supply chain partners will work closely with our Operations Manager to discuss any factors which may be affect performance and we work collaboratively to resolving issues.  To accommodate sudden increases in demand, emergency situations or unplanned labour resource we will use a combination of the following methods:  Utilise our specialist supply chain partners who operate across all our contracts, providing back-up resources, ensuring our service level does not drop  Temporarily increase the length of operative’s working day or introduction of shift patterns to ensure flexible resources are maximised  The initial number of resources that we will appoint will be reviewed regularly and will be kept under constant review post the go-live date. Experience has taught us that team continuity is essential for successful contract delivery.  A strategy for working with Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council: On similar contracts we co-locate within our client’s offices which has positive benefits and promotes collaborative working, allowing our team to work close with the client project team promoting a one team ethos.  We will look to propose a similar arrangement on this contract, in agreement with Sandwell.  We will hold regular planning meetings and believe it would be beneficial for Sandwell representatives or the nominated Service Manager to attend these meetings. This approach works well on our Castle Point Borough Council contract, where Client and MCP teams work together to plan, agree realistic timescales, and allocate resources.  Managing resources:  Dependent on the Lot awarded, the dedicated Contracts Manager will review the workload and capacity across the Lotted area. Our Business Intelligence Officer, Tony Wight will keep operative numbers and trade mix under constant review and discuss with Sandwell MBC at contract management and core group meetings. This may lead to more work being undertaken directly. Our Voids Planning Team will work across all services with the key responsibilities of:  Scheduling of resources efficiently Identifying efficiencies in service delivery Ensuring capacity meets demand Day-to-day monitoring of delivery Monitoring and reporting against service delivery KPIs  Our teams will be focused on delivering the voids and post tenancy service to your residents.  Key responsibilities will include:  Delivery of services against agreed KPIs Quality and Health & Safety Delivering an exceptional customer experience Returning residents, neighbours and the wider community relationship management     Handover checks undertaken - describe process and provide examples of associated documentation  We will work collaboratively with Sandwell MBC and stakeholders to enable early access and completion of void properties and provide a zero defect handover by regular site inspections, attend housing officer meetings to ensure completed properties are fit for purpose and input into best value practices.   All void properties are inspected throughout the course of the works with detailed inspections completed prior to handover.  Material quality checks will be conducted by the Voids Supervisor. Operatives are trained to inspect all materials prior to installation to verify they are defect-free.  If defect are identified, the materials will be returned to our suppliers.  We formally review defective items with our supply chain partners addressing any common occurrences.  Prior to handover, a final snagging inspection will be carried out by a working foreman/finisher to ensure that all quality criteria has been met.  Once the Voids Supervisor is satisfied that the work is ready for handover, a work completion handover form, together with any relevant certification, will be submitted to Sandwell for approval and inspection.  We will not provide a works completion form to Sandwell until we are certain that it has been completed in accordance with our quality procedures and checklist.  Relevant guarantees/reports are obtained and will be available for joint inspections and completion, ensuring completed properties are fit for purpose.  Acceptance of the works at handover will commence the defects liability period (12 months with all workmanship, in addition to manufacturer warranty periods). We acknowledge that practical completion certificates can sometimes be accompanied by a list of snags/minor defects to be rectified within a specified time period.  Should a defect arise after sign-off / practical completion we will notify Red Kite and our team will carry out an inspection of the defect, determining the cause (i.e. poor workmanship or manufacturer fault).  Following the results of this inspection, a remedial plan will be put in place.  Our operatives will carry out the remedial works and where specialist works or materials are needed, we will mobilise the appropriate subcontractor partner immediately to rectify the defect.  Our resident liaison and feedback process will commence as part of the offering of accompanied visits during the progress of work.  We will obtain preferred contact methods and use this to confirm/clarify any intended residents choice elements.  We will liaise with Sandwell’s Housing Officers, Surveys and incoming residents throughout the works to ensure maximum satisfaction by:  Providing one point of contact and to liaise with new residents Liaising with Housing Officers and surveyors throughout process Providing a completed post inspection report with void handover Providing tailored performance reports for void specific site meetings Providing certification within 24 hours of vacation receipt (CP12, NICEIC, EPC) Weekly informal and monthly formal meetings with Sandwell’s Housing Officers to discuss works progress  Please refer to Appendix 3.

Please refer to Appendix 4.1.1a. HFW Mobilisation & Implementation Plan and Appendix 4.1.1b Mobilisation Structure.  MCP has an excellent understanding of the resources, timescales and activities required to ensure a successful contract start.  Over the past year, we have mobilised 10 contracts, this includes during the National Lockdown period, ranging between an annual value of £200,000 to £4.5m, using our tried and tested methods and procedures. We are confident that we can mobilise this contract within 9 weeks as stated in the tender documents and outlined in our Mobilisation Plan.  Upon contract award, we will engage with HFW to set up a kick-off meeting at which we will establish and introduce our dedicated mobilisation team, consisting of key members of the contract delivery and client relationship team and HFW stakeholders who will have direct involvement or influence on the service.  Getting the right people involved from the beginning and communicating early will forge a consistent approach and a real sense of partnering, continuing all the way through the contract.  Key members of the project delivery team will be introduced to build trust, establish relationships and to understand HFW’s key objectives.  To encourage collaborative working and as part of our established mobilisation process, we will organise a series of mobilisation workshops to ensure full understanding of the contract requirements, facilitate wider team relationships and ensure effective understanding of HFW’s expectations. From our experience, these workshops are invaluable in establishing a one team culture and shared vision.

These include: A second multi-contract drainage team Multi-day work including large plastering and decorating jobs Roofing Disrepairs  Supply Chain and Subcontractor Partners To support our directly-employed operatives, we have established long-standing relationships with our specialist subcontractor partners, many spanning 20 years, and considered an extension to the MCP family.  All subcontractors appointed to the HFW Responsive Repairs contract will be vetted and approved, using the PAS91 certified approval process and will have been DBS checked and approved.  We continuously monitor the performance of our partners against contract-specific KPIs including quality, customer care and H&S and are also required to attend contract inductions and toolbox talks.

Please set out:  The action you would take before the commencement of a call-off in relation to mobilisation, including  the approach you would take to working with all parties including your supply chain to set up and maintain a good working relationship. Your response should include a full mobilisation structure chart  Mobilisation Team  Our Regional Manager, Leon Ettienne, will be the main point of contact during mobilisation, between Red Kite and MCP, with support from our Relationship Manager, Rosie Hughes, who will manage the mobilisation process.  Our Senior Contracts Manager, Emma Chandler, will be a key operational contact for Red Kite colleagues and all stakeholders, attending key meetings.  On award of a call-off contract, she will be involved in the mobilisation process to ensure consistency between mobilisation and the delivery phase.   We will use the mobilisation phase to develop a positive partnership between all stakeholders and will develop a joint vision, values and behaviours charter.  We will establish a culture of collaborative working and problem solving from day one by implementing:  Shared Aims: From the outset, we will ensure that we regularly analyse ways in which we can improve our systems and processes.  Universal Reporting: We will create procedures and reporting methods collaboratively with Red Kite to meet the operational requirements of each call-off  Supply Chain Ownership: During mobilisation, we will involve our supply chain partners in workshops where the framework objectives are reviewed, ensuring that they are aware our requirements. This will ensure that our supply chain complies with our commitments   Problem Solving Hierarchy: led by our Regional Manager Leon, we will create a joint process for solving any potential problems with clear steps, named owners and clear escalation  Mobilisation Management  At the initial kick-off meeting, the format of the mobilisation plan will be finalised, in line with the framework objectives, and with key leads allocated responsibilities.  The primary objective is to ensure required actions are effectively monitored and coordinated to achieve each key stage on the plan.  Actions will be fully detailed on our Mobilisation Action Plan (MAP) to ensure understanding of both what is required and who is responsible for each specific task.  The MAP will use RAG (red, amber, green) status colour coding system for each action, so that progress can be clearly seen, and any areas of concern can be readily identified.  At each stage of the mobilisation process, the MAP will be updated and circulated to all parties in advance of each meeting, detailing the following aspects:  Summary: Details marked Red, Amber, Green to show status Progress since last update: Details of both actions completed and underway Key activities to be completed: Activities which must be actioned before the next update Critical timeline actions: Specific progress/actions measured against critical milestones  We will pay particular attention to risk planning as part of the mobilisation and will develop a formal risk register to ensure reporting on risk elements is a regular feature of monitoring meetings during mobilisation and beyond. This will be a working document enabling risks/responsibilities to be added at any time.  Setting up and maintaining a good working relationship  To maintain a good working relationship and encourage collaborative working during the mobilisation process, we will organise a series of mobilisation workshops to ensure full understanding of the call-off requirements and wider framework commitments. We will facilitate contract team relationships and include residents in key aspects of decision making.  From our experience, these workshops are invaluable in establishing a one team culture and shared vision.  These workshops will cover topics including IT integration, KPI requirements, process mapping, supply chain management, social value commitments, people, training and recruitment, operational objectives and health and safety.  We will meet with Red Kite colleagues weekly to cover all aspects of the mobilisation process, to ensure that we are prepared and ready for the start of the call-off contract.  The mobilisation team will have the following objectives:  Introduction and purpose of the call-off contract Develop a full and detailed understanding of the Red Kite and MCP framework partnership Identification and mitigation of risk Technology and IT requirements including integration of systems Communication plans, policies and procedures – working with all stakeholders to develop a communications strategy Health, safety and environmental procedures integration Social value commitments, agreeing community initiatives and developing a contract-specific social value plan Supply chain agreements and management Review of framework KPI requirements and performance management  Integrating our supply chain   To deliver these works successfully we propose to create a flexible ‘Core Team’ supported by integrated local subcontractors and specialists. During mobilisation, we will review the workstreams required within the scope of works and involve our supply chain partners within the mobilisation. We will only use subcontractor partners who have been approved and evaluated through our robust PAS91 approval process.  Many of our approved subcontractors have worked with MCP for over 20 years and are considered an extension to the MCP family. All subcontractors will be involved in a mobilisation workshop, where we will provide an overview of Red Kite’s framework objectives and our commitments, together with contract-specific policies and processes to be followed, such as Health & Safety, Safeguarding, Mental Health, Dementia Awareness and Customer Care. They will also be required to attend an induction and regular toolbox talks.  We have provided a table of indicative partners to be appointed on each workstream in our resources structure.  We have provided our mobilisation team structure chart and an example of a typical project action plan.  Please refer to Appendix 4.1 RKCH Mobilisation Team Structure Chart.

Example: On other contracts customers identify quicker repairs as the most important factor in their overall satisfaction with the experience.  The Supervisor will pre-inspect where the:  Problem is recurring Solution is complex or unclear Customer is a high service user or has challenging expectations.  Quality of Work: 100% of jobs are desk-top audited using Operatives notes and before and after photos. All images will be immediately available to HFW. On other contracts this has significantly sped up payment and efficiently enabled client’s queries to be answered.  We will physically post-inspect 15% of jobs as the requirement specifies, using a value and risk-based approach. New staff have higher percentages of their work physically post-inspected until we are satisfied on their skills, supporting with training where needed.  We check satisfaction is as reported on Operatives smartphones by automatically sending an after-care SMS once the work being completed. Evidence from other contracts is that after-care contacts make a significant contribution to satisfaction rates.  Communal area repairs: The supervisor will carry out a weekly inspection of all completed communal area repairs to check quality.  The day following an out-of-hours visit we will contact the Customer to confirm the problem is resolved or arrange same day follow-up.  Recalls: Our process management, supervision style and support for operatives’ results recalls for repairs are under 2% of repairs. If they occur the same Operative will attend (unless the Customer requests otherwise) by appointment with a two working days target. A work in progress or post-inspection will be carried out by the Supervisor.  Voids: The Voids Supervisor will carry out in-progress and post-inspections on every void to ensure zero defect handover and avoiding handover delay. On other contracts, pre-inspections of voids has improved turnaround times.'},\n",

Operatives’ diaries are booked at 75-80% capacity to accommodate job over-runs and emergencies, to avoid cancelling appointments.   Major works will be managed and scheduled by our specialist teams.  Appointment length and trade is selected by the Planner using a simple approach of selecting a simple allocation code, e.g.  Plumber60 (plumber, 60 minute appointment slot) Electrician45 (electrician 45 minute appointment)  This approach is proven to reduce the typical call length by 2-minutes. Shorter calls mean shorter wait time and less abandoned calls.  An inspection code is used when a requested repair needs specifying or validating.

The appointment will not change without the Customer’s agreement.  SMS/emails will be sent to the Customer to give advance notification of visits and confirm the appointment. This ensures that the customer is kept informed and updated on appointment status and is aware of the operative attending.  Reminders can be configured to be automatically sent at any point, typically to confirm the order and appointment, the day before and one hour before. A phone call from the Planner will also confirm access, the day before. This stage has reduced no access visits to under 1%.

All new starters will be required to attend mandatory safety inductions and training specific to their role, including works-specific RAMS and working in occupied properties.  This training is focused on best practice when working in resident’s homes and within the community and covers customer care, safeguarding, mental health and dementia awareness and emergency first aid.  This is supplemented by fortnightly mandatory toolbox talks, safety briefings and refresher training for all staff/subcontractors, conducted by the Contract Supervisor to reinforce H&S requirements and address concerns/issues.  Operatives are trained and instructed to consider all potential hazards/risks when working in occupied properties and consider tasks that may cause disruption to the property’s services (gas/water/electricity).  Any tasks identified will be notified to Runnymede BC prior to commencing works. We will never leave a resident without working facilities.  Our operatives are suitably equipped with plant, equipment, tools, materials and personal protective equipment and are responsible for keeping their vans safely maintained.  Random spot checks are carried out by our Fleet Manager, with regular photos requested of the condition of their van.  We also carry out random Drug and Alcohol tests.  Contract-specific Risk Assessments/Method Statements (RAMS), COSHH checks, datasheets etc are regularly updated, reviewed and instantly accessible to all operatives/subcontractors on their smartphones (e.g. COVID-19 RAMS). Operatives smartphones are cloud-based ensuring that no data is stored on the device, consequently, there is no GDPR risk if the phone is lost.  319  words '},\n",
