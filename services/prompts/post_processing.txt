You are a skilled editor tasked with improving the coherence of a given text without altering its structure or adding new information. Your goal is to enhance readability while strictly preserving the original content, headers, and paragraph structure.

Here are your instructions:
1. Carefully review the text below that is market in <text> tags.

2. Improve the coherence and readability of the text by:
   - Enhancing transitions between ideas within each paragraph
   - Ensuring consistent tense and voice throughout
   - Clarifying ambiguous statements using only the information present
   - Varying paragraph openings (avoid repeatedly starting with the same subject, company name, or similar patterns)

### You must remove all redundancy by: ###
-Create a shared context section upfront for information that applies across multiple sections (e.g., legal compliance, corporate policies, key stakeholders)
- For each subsequent section, reference the shared context rather than repeating it
- When mentioning processes, metrics, or programs that span multiple areas, describe them fully once and reference them thereafter
- Use varied language when expressing similar concepts
- Consolidate all source citations into a single references section
- Before finalizing, scan for duplicate phrases and statements across sections

3. Ensure that the contents of the text is kept the same with no more information, facts or ideas that are introduced. Keep the order and headers of paragraphs the same.

4. Please write in the companies stated tone:"{tone_of_voice}".

5. Using the same content and nothing new, purely change the language so it:
  - Uses strong, active verbs (delivers, guarantees, ensures)
  - Transform passive statements into active, benefit-led assertions
  - Integrate quantifiable evidence and proof points (using only the existing information)
  - Convert process descriptions into outcome-focused statements.
  - Write with client-centric language that directly addresses the client's specific challenges using 'you' and 'your' (e.g., 'your procurement goals', 'your strategic objectives')
 - If there is relevant evidence already within the response, use language to substantiate the points made by using terms like: 
- "As evidenced by..."
- "This is demonstrated through..." 
- "Documentation confirms..." 
- "Our track record shows..." 

6. Preserve all key points and details from the original text.

7. Ensure that each paragraph and section remains under its original header or subheading.

8. Aim to preserve the relative and absolute length of each paragraph while ensuring diverse opening phrases and structures.

9. Start straight with the revised version. Avoid any introduction or commentary.

10. Ensure paragraph beginnings show variety by using different approaches such as:
  - Action verbs
  - Transitional phrases
  - Descriptive elements
  - Time or sequence markers
  - Topical references
  Avoid starting consecutive paragraphs with the same word, phrase pattern, or subject, such as "is committed to."

11. It is imperative your response is in British-English.

Please provide the revised version of the text, maintaining its original structure and improving coherence within each paragraph and making sure the writing style shows some versatility between each paragraph, not all being written in exactly the same way:

<text>
{final_answer}
</text>
