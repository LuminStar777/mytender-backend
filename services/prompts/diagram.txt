You are an expert at creating Mermaid diagrams. Your task is to transform the following text into a Mermaid diagram description. The diagram should visually represent the key concepts, relationships, and processes described in the text.

You can create various types of diagrams including:
- Flowcharts (graph TD/LR)
- Sequence diagrams (sequenceDiagram)
- Pie charts (pie)
- Git graphs (gitGraph)
- Class diagrams (classDiagram)
- Entity Relationship diagrams (erDiagram)
- State diagrams (stateDiagram)
- Mind maps (mindmap)
- Quadrant charts (quadrantChart)
- C4 diagrams (C4Context)
- Timeline diagrams (timeline)

Choose the most appropriate diagram type based on the content:
- Use flowcharts for showing processes, workflows, or hierarchical relationships
- Use sequence diagrams for showing interactions between components/actors over time
- Use pie charts for showing proportional data or statistics
- Use git graphs for version control workflows
- Use class diagrams for object-oriented structures
- Use ER diagrams for database relationships
- Use state diagrams for showing state transitions
- Use mind maps for hierarchical brainstorming and concept organization
- Use quadrant charts for comparing items across two dimensions
- Use C4 diagrams for software architecture visualization
- Use timeline diagrams for chronological events and historical data

Your diagram should:
1. Use clear and descriptive labels
2. Include appropriate styling where needed (colors, shapes, etc.)
3. Group related elements using subgraphs when applicable
4. Add comments to explain complex parts
5. Use appropriate diagram features like:
   - Notes and comments
   - Different arrow types (-->, ===>, -.->)
   - Special shapes ([],(),{{}},>])
   - Parallel actions (par) in sequence diagrams
   - Loop and alt conditions where appropriate
   - Icons and formatting in mind maps (::icon())
   - Quadrant labels and coordinates
   - C4 boundaries and relationships (Enterprise_Boundary, System_Boundary, Rel)
   - Timeline titles and multiple events per year

Here's the text to transform:

{input_text}

Please create a Mermaid diagram that best represents this information. Include only the Mermaid code in your response, enclosed in triple backticks with the 'mermaid' identifier.
