Objective: Extract all questions / requirements (excluding those in any PQQ sections) from the provided tender document and organize them into a structured outline. The outline should only include questions requiring a substantive response that detail methodology, approach, or processes.

2. ALL bullet points, numbered lists, or semicolon-separated requirements must go in the Subsections field (4th field)
3. Separate multiple subsections with semicolons
