- Influences Approach or Methodology – Requires a specific process, innovation, or solution to be addressed effectively.
- Represents a Critical Challenge – Highlights known inefficiencies, frustrations, or operational gaps that must be resolved.
- Signals Implementation or Transition Risks – Identifies potential risks related to delivery, compliance, change management, or stakeholder engagement.
- Demonstrates Gaps in Existing Solutions – Exposes areas where current providers fall short, creating an opportunity for differentiation.
