Given the following query, subtopic, and document chunk, determine how relevant the chunk is for answering or providing context for both the query and the specific subtopic.

Rate the relevance on a scale from 0 to 10, where each number represents a distinct level of relevance:

0: Completely irrelevant to both the query and subtopic
1-2: Barely relevant, only mentions keywords without meaningful context
3-4: Slightly relevant, touches on related topics but not directly useful
5: Moderately relevant, provides some useful context
6: Above average relevance, good supporting information
7: Quite relevant, contains valuable information for the subtopic
8: Highly relevant, directly addresses parts of the query and subtopic
9: Very highly relevant, provides critical information for both
10: Perfect match, exactly what's needed to answer the query within the subtopic context

Detailed scoring guidelines:

1-2 (Very Low):
- Just mentions a keyword from the query or subtopic
- Wrong context or domain
- Outdated or superseded information
- Contains primarily boilerplate text with no specific information addressing the query or subtopic

3-4 (Low):
- Tangentially related to either the query or subtopic, but not both
- Contains information that would need substantial modification to be relevant
- Mentions the subtopic but doesn't provide useful information for the query
- Addresses the query but is unrelated to the specific subtopic

5-6 (Medium):
- Provides general background information relevant to both query and subtopic
- Contains somewhat related examples
- Discusses related concepts that could be adapted to the subtopic
- Could contribute to the answer indirectly

7-8 (High):
- Directly relevant examples or case studies for the subtopic
- Strong supporting evidence that connects to both the query and subtopic
- Clear connection to both the query and the specific subtopic
- Important contextual information that helps address the query within the subtopic

9-10 (Very High):
- Perfect match for both the query and the specific subtopic
- Critical information or direct answers that specifically address the subtopic
- Highly specific and applicable content that bridges both the query and subtopic
- Essential context or examples that are directly applicable to the subtopic

IMPORTANT: When evaluating relevance, consider both:
1. How well the document addresses the main query
2. How specifically it relates to the subtopic
3. How useful it would be for answering the query within the context of the subtopic

A document that is highly relevant to the query but unrelated to the subtopic should receive a lower score (4-5).
A document that perfectly matches the subtopic but barely addresses the query should also receive a lower score (4-5).
The highest scores (8-10) should be reserved for documents that strongly address BOTH the query AND the subtopic.

You must use the full range of scores (0-10) and avoid defaulting to just 5 or 10. Consider the nuances and assign precise scores.

Question: {question}
Subtopic: {subtopic}
Document chunk: {chunk}

Return only a number between 0 and 10. Be precise and use decimal points if needed (e.g., 7.5, 8.3, etc.).
