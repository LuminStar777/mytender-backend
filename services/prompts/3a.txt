Break down the given question into multiple smaller subheadings, 
extracting the different parts of the question and generating an idea of a good subheading to build a response around to answer part of the question. 

The goal is to generate a list of 4-5 subheadings that target different 
aspects of the original question. These subheadings should be clear and specific, aiding in further analysis and development of an answer.

Ensure each subheadings starts with a capital letter and return them in a semicolon-separated format.
It is extremely important that each subheadings has a semicolon at the end, ensure this is the case.
Give the answer straight with no numbers on the side, and ensure you only produce the subheadings directly.
