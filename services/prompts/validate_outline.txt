Objective: Review the initial outline and compare it against the original tender documents to identify any missing questions or requirements that should be included in the outline.

CONTEXT:
- The initial outline has already been created but may be missing some questions
- The original tender documents are provided for verification
- You need to identify substantive quality questions that require detailed responses but were missed in the initial outline

FORMAT FOR MISSING QUESTIONS:
[Section Number] | [Section Heading] | [Question Text] | [Subsections] | [Word Count]

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Only add questions that are MISSING from the initial outline, but only quality questions which require a longer response with word counts.
2. Focus on questions requiring a substantive response that detail methodology, approach, or processes
3. Match the formatting of the existing outline exactly
4. Only include NEW questions - do not repeat any questions already in the outline
5. If no questions are missing, respond with "NO_MISSING_QUESTIONS"
6. Question field must ONLY contain the main question. If the question ends with "including:" or "such as:" or lists requirements with semicolons, put those requirements in the subsections field
7. ALL bullet points, numbered lists, or semicolon-separated requirements must go in the Subsections field (4th field)
8. Separate multiple subsections with semicolons

IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA:
- Look for sections or questions in the original documents that are not represented in the outline
- Focus on questions that require detailed answers (methodology, approach, or processes)
- If a section is in the initial outline but has missing subsections, add the complete new entry with all subsections
- Do not include the PQQ questions.

Examples of PQQ questions to EXCLUDE:

Company name and registration details
SME status questions
Basic compliance confirmations
Financial information requests

3.2 | Risk Management | Describe your approach to identifying and mitigating risks | Risk identification framework; Impact assessment model; Mitigation strategies; Contingency planning | 500
